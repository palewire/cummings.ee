 Who
     threw the silver dollar up into the tree?
                                               I didn’t said the little
 lady who sews and grows every day paler-paler she sits sewing and grow-
 ing and that’s the truth,
 who threw
 
          the ripe melon into the tree?you
                                           got me said the smoke who
 runs the elevator but I bet two bits come seven come eleven mm make
 the world safe for democracy it never fails and that’s a fact;
 
 who threw the
 
 bunch of violets
                  into the tree?I dunno said the silver dog,   with ripe
 eyes and wagged his tail that’s the god’s own
 
 and the moon kissed the little lady on her paler-paler face and said
 never mind,you’ll find
                        But the moon creeped into the pink hand of the
 smoke that shook the ivories
                              and she said said She Win and you won’t be
 
 sorry    And The Moon came!along-along to the waggy silver dog
 and the moon came
 and the Moon said into his Ripe Eyes
                                      and the moon
                                                   Smiled
