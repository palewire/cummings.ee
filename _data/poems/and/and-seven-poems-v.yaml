 gee i like to think of dead it means nearer because deeper firmer
 since darker than little round water at one end of the well  it’s
 too cool to be crooked and it’s too firm to be hard but it’s sharp
 and thick and it loves,   every old thing falls in rosebugs and
 jackknives and kittens and pennies they all sit there looking at
 each other having the fastest time because they’ve never met before

 dead’s more even than how many ways of sitting on your head your
 unnatural hair has in the morning

 dead’s clever too like POF goes the alarm off and the little striker
 having the best time tickling away everybody’s brain so everybody
 just puts out their finger and they stuff the poor thing all full
 of fingers

 dead has a smile like the nicest man you’ve never met who maybe winks
 at you in a streetcar and you pretend you don’t but really you do
 see and you are My how glad he winked and hope he’ll do it again

 or if it talks about you somewhere behind your back it makes your neck
 feel pleasant and stoopid   and if dead says may i have this one and
 was never introduced you say Yes because you know you want it to dance
 with you and it wants to and it can dance and Whocares

 dead’s fine like hands do you see that water flowerpots in windows but
 they live higher in their house that you so that’s all you see but you
 don’t want to

 dead’s happy like the way underclothes All so differently solemn and
 inti and sitting on one string

 dead never says my dear,Time for your musiclesson and you like music and
 to have somebody play who can but you know you never can and why have to?

 dead’s nice like a dance where you danced simple hours and you take all
 your prickly-clothes off and squeeze-into-largeness without one word   and
 you lie still as anything   in largeness and this largeness begins to give
 you,the dance all over again and you,feel all again all over the way men

 you liked made you feel when they touched you(but that’s not all)because
 largeness tells you so you can feel what you made,men feel when,you touched,
 them

 dead’s sorry like a thistlefluff-thing which goes landing away all by
 himself on somebody’s roof or something where who-ever-heard-of-growing
 and nobody expects you to anyway

 dead says comes with me he says(andwhyevernot)into the round well and
 see the kitten and the penny and the jackknife and the rosebug
                                                               and you
 say Sure you say   (like that)   sure i’ll come with you you say for i
 like kittens i do and jackknives i do and pennies i do and rosebugs i do
