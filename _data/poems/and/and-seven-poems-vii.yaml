first_line: who knows if the moon’s

text: |-1
 who knows if the moon’s
 a balloon,coming out of a keen city
 in the sky—filled with pretty people?
 (and if you and i should

 get into it,if they
 should take me and take you into their balloon.
 why then
 we’d go up higher with all the pretty people

 than houses and steeples and clouds:
 go sailing
 away and away sailing into a keen
 city which nobody’s ever visited,where

 always
        it’s
             Spring)and everyone’s
 in love and flowers pick themselves
