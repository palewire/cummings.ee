 the waddling
 madam star
 taps
 taps.     “ready girls”.   the

 unspontaneous streets
 make bright their eyes
 a
 blind irisher fiddles a

 scotch jig in a stinking
 joyman bar
 a cockney is
 buying whiskies for a turk

 a waiter intones:bloo-moon-n
 sirkusricky
 platzburg
 hoppytoad    yesmam.    the

 furious taximan
 p(ee)ps
 on his whistle somebody
 says here’s luck

 somebody else says down the hatch
 the nigger smiles
 the jew stands
 beside his teddy-bears

 the sailor shuffles the
 night with fucking eyes
 the great black preacher gargles jesus
 the aesthete indulges

 his soul for certain things which died
 itis eighteen hundred
 years....
 exactly

    under the window
    under the window
    under the window walk

 the unburied feet of
 the little ladies more than dead
