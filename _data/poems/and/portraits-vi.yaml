 Cleopatra built
 like a smooth arrow or
 a fleet pillar is eaten
 by yesterday

 she was a silver tube of wise
 lust whose arms and legs
 like white squirming pipes
 wiggle upon the perfumed roman

 strength who how
 furiously plays the hot
 sweet horrible stops of
 her

 body
 Cleopatra had a
 body
 it was

 thick slim warm moist
 built like an organ
 and it
 loved

 he
 was a roman    theirs was a
 music sinuous globular
 slippery intense witty huge

 and its chords
 brittle eager eternal luminous
 firmly diminishing have swoopingly
 fallen svelte sagging gone into the soaring silence

 (put
 your smallest
 ear against yester-
 day My Lady    hear

 the purple trumpets
 blow    horses of gold
 delicately crouching beneath silver
 youths    the leaneyed

 Caesars borne neatly through enormous
 twilight surrounded by their triumphs
 and
     listen well

 how the dainty destroyed
 hero clamps the hearty sharp
 column
 of Egypt

         ,build like a fleet
 pillar or a smooth
 arrow
 Cleopatra is eaten by

 yester-
 day)
         O i tell you out of
 the minute incessant Was irrevocably

 emanates a dignity of papyruscoloured
 faces    superbly limp
 the ostensible centuries
 therefore let us be

 a little uncouth and amorous in
 memory of Cleopatra and of
 Antony
 and we will

 confuse hotly our moreover irrevocable
 bodies while the infinite processions
 move like moths and like boys and
 like incense and like sunlight

 and like ships and like young girls and like
 butterflies and like money
 and like laughter
 and like elephants

 through our
 single
 brain    in memory of Cleopatra    while
 easily

 tremendously
 floats
 in the bright shouting street of time
 her nakedness with its blue hair

 (all is eaten by yester-
 day
 between the nibbling timid teethful hours
 wilts the stern texture of Now

 the arrow and the
 pillar pursue curiously
 a crumbling flight into the absolute stars
 the gods are swallowed

 even
 Nile
 the
 kind black great god)

 Cleopatra you
 are eaten
 by yester-
 day

 (and O My Lady Lady Of
 Ladies you
 who move beautifully in the winds
 of my lust like a high troubling

 ship upon the fragrant
 unspeaking ignorant darkness of New
 Lady whose kiss is
 a procession of deep beasts

 coming with keen ridiculous
 silks coming with sharp languid perfumes
 coming with the little profound gems and
 the large laughing stones

 a sinuous problem of colour
 floating against
 the clever deadly
 heaven    i salute

 you
 whose body is
 Egypt
 whose hair is Nile)

 put your ear
 to the ground
 there is a music
 Lady

           the noiseless truth of swirling
 worms
 is
 tomorrow
