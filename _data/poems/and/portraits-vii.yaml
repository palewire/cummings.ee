 between the breasts
 of bestial
 Marj lie large
 men who praise
 
 Marj’s cleancornered strokable
 body     these men’s
 fingers toss trunks
 shuffle sacks spin kegs they
 
 curl
 loving
 around
 beers
 
       the world has
 these men’s hands but their
 bodies big and boozing
 belong to
 
 Marj
 the greenslim purse of whose
 face opens
 on a fatgold
 
 grin
 hooray
 hoorah for the large
 men who lie
 
 between the breasts
 of bestial Marj
 for the strong men
 who
 
 sleep between the legs of Lil
