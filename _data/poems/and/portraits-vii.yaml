 between the breasts
 of bestial
 Marj lie large
 men who praise

 Marj’s cleancornered strokable
 body     these men’s
 fingers toss trunks
 shuffle sacks spin kegs they

 curl
 loving
 around
 beers

       the world has
 these men’s hands but their
 bodies big and boozing
 belong to

 Marj
 the greenslim purse of whose
 face opens
 on a fatgold

 grin
 hooray
 hoorah for the large
 men who lie

 between the breasts
 of bestial Marj
 for the strong men
 who

 sleep between the legs of Lil
