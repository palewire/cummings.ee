 when the spent days begins to frail
 (whose grave already three or two
 young stars with spades of silver dig)

 by beauty i declare to you

 if what i am at one o’clock
 to little lips(which have not sinned
 in whose displeasure lives a kiss)
 kneeling,your frequent mercy begs,

 sharply believe me,wholly,well
 —did(wisely suddenly into
 a dangerous womb of cringing air)
 the largest hour push deep his din

 of wallowing male(shock beyond shock
 blurted)strokes,vibrant with the purr
 of echo pouring in a mesh
 of following tone:did this and this

 spire strike midnight(and did occur
 bell beyond fiercely spurting bell
 a jetted music splashing fresh
 upon silence)i without fail

 entered because and was these twin
 imminent lisping bags of flesh;
 became eyes moist lithe shuddering big,
 the luminous laughter,and the legs

 one,i am this blueeyed Finn
 emerging from a lovehouse who
 buttons his coat against the wind
