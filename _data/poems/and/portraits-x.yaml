 here is little Effie’s head
 whose brains are made of gingerbread
 when the judgment day comes
 God will find six crumbs

 stooping by the coffinlid
 waiting for something to rise
 as the other somethings did—
 you imagine His surprise

 bellowing through the general noise
 Where is Effie who was dead?
 —to God in a tiny voice.
 i am may the first crumb said

 whereupon its fellow five
 crumbs chuckled as if they were alive
 and number two took up the song,
 might i’m called and did no wrong

 cried the third crumb,i am should
 and this is my little sister could
 with our big brother who is would
 don’t punish us for we were good;

 and the last crumb with some shame
 whispered unto God,my name
 is must and with the other i’ve
 been Effie who isn’t alive

 just imagine it I say
 God amid a monstrous din
 watch your step and follow me
 stooping by Effie’s little,in

 (want a match or can you see?)
 which the six subjunctive crumbs
 twitch like mutilated thumbs:
 picture His peering biggest whey

 coloured face on which a frown
 puzzles,but I know the way—
 (nervously Whose eyes approve
 the blessed while His ears are crammed

 with the strenuous music of
 the innumerable capering damned)
 —staring wildly up and down
 and here we are now judgment day

 cross the threshold have no dread
 lift the sheet back in this way.
 here is little Effie’s head
 whose brains are made of gingerbread
