 this wind is a Lady with
 bright slender eyes(who

 moves)at sunset
 and who—touches—the
 hills without any reason

 (i have spoken with this
 indubitable and green person “Are
 You the wind?” “Yes” “why do you touch flowers
 as if they were unalive,as

 if They were ideas?” “because,sir
 things which in my mind blossom will
 stumble beneath a clumsiest disguise,appear
 capable of fragility and indecision

 —do not suppose these
 without any reason and otherwise
 roses and mountains
 different from the i am who wanders

 imminently across the renewed world”
 to me said the)wind being A lady in a green
 dress,who;touches:the fields
 (at sunset)
