 Take for example this:

 if to the colour of midnight
 to a more than darkness(which
 is myself and Paris and all
 things)the bright
 rain
 occurs deeply, beautifully

 and i(being at a window
 in this midnight)
                for no reason feel
 deeply completely conscious of the rain or rather
 Somebody who uses roofs and streets skilfully to make a
 possible and beautiful sound:

 if a(perhaps)clock strikes, in the alive
 coolness, very faintly and
 finally through altogether delicate gestures of rain

 a colour comes, which is morning, O do not wonder that
 
 (just at the edge of day)i surely
 make a millionth poem which will not wholly
 miss you; or if i certainly create, lady,
 one of the thousand selves who are your smile.
