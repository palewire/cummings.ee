 Paris;this April sunset completely utters;
 utters serenely silently a cathedral

 before whose upward lean magnficent face
 the streets turn young with rain,

 spiral acres of bloated rose
 coiled within cobalt miles of sky
 yield to and heed
 the mauve
           of twilight(who slenderly descends,
 daintily carrying in her eyes the dangerous first stars)
 people move love hurry in a gently

 arriving gloom and
 see!(the new moon
 fills abruptly with sudden silver
 these torn pockets of lame and begging colour)while
 there and here the lithe indolent prostitute
 Night,argues

 with certain houses
