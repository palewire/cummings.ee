 my smallheaded pearshaped

 lady in gluey twilight
 moving,suddenly

 is three animals.  The
 minute waiste continually

 with an African gesture

 utters a frivolous intense half of
 Girl which(like some

 floating snake upon itself always and
 slowly which upward certainly is pouring)emits
 a pose
       :to twitter wickedly

 whereas the big and firm legs moving solemnly
 like careful and furious and beautiful elephants

 (mingled in whispering thickly smooth thighs
 thinkingly)
 remind me of Woman and

 how between
 her hips India is.
