 i was sitting in mcsorley’s    outside it was New York and beauti-
 fully snowing.

 Inside snug and evil.    the slobbering walls filthily push witless
 creases of screaming warmth chuck pillows are noise funnily swallows
 swallowing revolvingly pompous a the swallowed mottle with smooth or
 a but of rapidly goes gobs the and of flecks of and a chatter sobbings
 intersect with which distinct disks of graceful oath,upsoarings the
 break on     ceiling-flatness

 the Bar.tinking lucious jigs dint of ripe silver with warmlyish
 wetflat splurging smells waltz the glush of squirting taps plus slush
 of foam knocked off and a faint piddle-of-drops she says I ploc spittle
 what the lands thaz me kid in no sir hopping sawdust you kiddo he’s a
 palping wreaths of badly Yep cigars who jim him why gluey grins topple
 together eyes pout gestures stickily point made glints squinting who’s
 a wink bum-nothing and money fuzzily mouths take big wobbly foot-steps
 every goggle cent of it get out ears dribbles soft right old feller
 belch the chap hic summore eh chuckles skulch....

 and i aws sitting in the din thinking drinking the ale,which never
 lets you grow old blinking at the low ceiling my being pleasantly was
 punctuated by the always retchings of a worthless lamp.

 when With a minute terrif    iceffort one dirty squeal of soiling light
 yanKing from bushy obscurity a bald greenish foetal head established
 It suddenly upon the huge neck around whose unwashed sonorous muscle
 the filth of a collar hung gently.

 (spattered)by this instant of semiluminous nausea A vast wordless
 nondescript genie of trunk trickled firmly in to one exactly-mutilated
 ghost of a chair,

 a;domeshaped interval of complete plasticity,shoulders,sprouted the
 extraordinary arms through an angle of ridiculous velocity commenting
 upon an unclean table,and,whose distended immense Both paws slowly
 loved a dinted mug

 gone Darkness    it was so near to me,i ask of shadow won’t you have a
 drink?

 (the eternal perpetual question)

 Inside snugandevil.    i was sitting in mcsorley’s    It,did not answer.

 outside.(it was New York and beautifully,snowing....
