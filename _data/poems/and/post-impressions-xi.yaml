 my eyes are fond of the east side

 of raving colour,on either side the windows are packed with hardslippery
 greens and helplessbaby blues and stic-ky chromes and prettylemons and
 virginal pinks and wealthy vermilion and breathless-scarlet,dark colours
 like ’cellos keen fiddling colours colours cOOler than harps colours
 p r i c k i n glike piccolos thumPing colours like a bangofpiano colours
 which,are,the,flowery pluckings of a harpsichord colours of Pure percus-
 sion colours-like-trumpets they(writhe they,struggleinweird chords of
