 Life is an old man carrying flowers on his head.

 young death sits in a café
 smiling,a piece of money held between
 his thumb and first finger

 (i say “will he buy flowers” to you
 and “Death is young
 life wears velour trousers
 life totters,life has a beard” i

 say to you who are silent.—“Do you see
 Life?he is there and here,
 or that,or this
 or nothing or an old man 3 thirds
 asleep,on his head
 flowers,always crying
 to nobody something about les
 roses les bluets
                  yes,
                      will He buy?
 Les belles bottes—oh hear
 pas chères”)

 and my love slowly answered I think so.  But
 I think I see someone else

 there is a lady,whose name is Afterwards
 she is sitting beside young death,is slender;
 likes flowers.
