text: |-1
 when my love comes to see me it’s
 just a little like music,a
 little more like curving colour(say
 orange)
        against silence,or darkness....

 the coming of my love emits
 a wonderful smell in my mind,

 you should see when i turn to find
 her how my least heart-beat becomes less.
 And then all her beauty is a vise

 whose stilling lips murder suddenly me,

 but of my corpose the tool her smile makes something
 suddenly luminous and precise

 —and then we are I and She....

 what is that the hurdy-gurdy’s playing
