 it is funny,you will be dead some day.
 By you the mouth hair eyes,and i mean
 the unique and nervously obscene

 need;it’s funny.   They will all be dead

 knead of lustfulhunched deeplytoplay
 lips and stare the gross fuzzy-pash
 —dash—and the dark gold delicately smash....
 grass,and the stars,of my shoulder in stead.

 It is a funny,thing.   And you will be

 and i and all the days and nights that matter
 knocked by sun moon jabbed jerked with ecstasy
 ....tremble(not knowing how much better

 than me will you like the rain’s face and

 the rich improbable hands of the Wind)
