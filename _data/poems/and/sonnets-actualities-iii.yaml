 i have loved,let us see if that’s all.
 Bit into you as teeth, in the stone
 of a musical fruit.   My lips pleasantly groan
 on your taste.   Jumped the quick wall

 of your smile into stupid gardens
 if this were not enough(not really enough
 pulled one before one the vague tough

 exquisite

          flower,whom hardens
 richly,darkness.   On the whole
 possibly have i loved....?you)
                               sheath before sheath

 stripped to the Odour.    (and here’s what WhoEver will know
 Had you as bite teeth;
 i stood with you as a foal

 stands but as the trees,lay,which grow
