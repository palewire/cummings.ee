 i have loved,let us see if that’s all.
 Bit into you as teeth, in the stone
 of a musical fruit.   My lips pleasantly groan
 on your taste.   Jumped the quick wall
 
 of your smile into stupid gardens
 if this were not enough(not really enough

 stripped to the Odour.    (and here’s what WhoEver will know
 Had you as bite teeth;

 stands but as the trees,lay,which grow
