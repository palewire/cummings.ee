 let’s live suddenly without thinking

 under honest trees,
                    a stream
 does,the brain of cleverly-crinkling
 -water pursues the angry dream
 of the shore.   By midnight,
                             a moon
 scratches the skin of the organised hills

 an edged nothing begins to prune

 let’s live like the light that kills
 and let’s as silence,
                      because Whirl’s after all:
 (after me)love,and after you
 I occasionally feel vague how
 vague i don’t know tenuous Now-
 spears and The Then-arrows making do
 our mouths something red,something tall
