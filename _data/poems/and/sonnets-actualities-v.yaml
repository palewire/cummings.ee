 before the fragile gradual throne of night
 slowly when several stars are opening
 one beyond one immaculate curving
 cool treasures of silence
                          (slenderly wholly
 rising,herself uprearing wholly slowly,
 lean in the hips and her sails filled with dream—
 when on a green brief gesture of twilight
 trembles the imagined galleon of Spring)
 
 somewhere unspeaking sits my life;the grim
 clenched mind of me somewhere begins again,
 shares the year’s perfect agony.   Waiting
 
 (always)upon a fragile instant when
 
 herself me(slowly, wholly me)will press
 in the young lips unearthly slenderness
