 when i have thought of you somewhat too
 much and am become perfectly and
 simply Lustful....sense a gradual stir
 of beginning muscle,and what it will do
 to me before shutting....understand
 i love you....feel your suddenly body reach
 for me with a speed of white speech

 (the simple instant of perfect hunger
 Yes)
     how beautifully swims
 the fooling world in my huge blood,
 cracking brains A swiftlyenormous light
 —and furiously puzzling through,prismatic,whims
 the chattering self perceives with hysterical fright

 a comic tadpole wriggling in delicious mud
