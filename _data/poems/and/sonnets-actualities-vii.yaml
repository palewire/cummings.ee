 autumn is:that between there and here
 gladness flays hideously hills.
 It was in the spring of this very year

 (a spring of wines women and window-sills)
 i met that hideous gladness,per the face
 —pinxit,who knows?   Who knows?   Some “allemand”....?
 of Goethe,since exempt from heaven’s grace,

 in an engraving belonging to my friend.
 Whom i salute,by what is dear to us;
 and by a gestured city stilled in the framing
 twilight of Spring....and the dream of dreaming
 —and i fall back,quietly amorous
 of,through the autumn indisputably roaming

 death’s big rotten particular kiss.
