 if i should sleep with a lady called death
 get another man with firmer lips
 to take your new mouth in his teeth
 (hips pumping pleasure into hips).

 Seeing how the limp huddling string
 of your smile over his body squirms
 kissingly,i will bring you every spring
 handfuls of little normal worms.

 Dress deftly your flesh in stupid stuffs,
 phrase the immense weapon of your hair.
 Understanding why his eye laughs.
 i will bring you every year

 something which is worth the whole,
 an inch of nothing for your soul.
