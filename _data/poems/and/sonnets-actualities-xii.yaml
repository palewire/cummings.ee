 i have found what you are like
 the rain.

          (Who feathers frightened fields
 with the superior dust-of-sleep.  wields

 easily the pale club of the wind
 and swirled justly souls of flower strike

 the air in utterable coolness

 deeds of green thrilling light
                                with thinned

 newfragile yellows

                     lurch and.press

 —in the woods
               which
                     stutter
                             and

                                 sing
 And the coolness of your smile is
 stirringofbirds between my arms;but
 i should rather than anything
 have(almost when hugeness will shut
 quietly)almost,
                your kiss
