 the ivory performing rose
 
 of you, worn upon my mind
 all night, quitting only in the unkind
 
 dawn its muscle amorous
 
 pricks with minute odour these gross
 days
      when i think of you and do not live:
 and the empty twilight cannot grieve
 nor the autumns, as i grieve,faint for your face
 
 O stay with me slighty.   or until
 
 with neat obscure obvious hands
 
 Time stuff the sincere stomach of each mill
 
 of the ingenious gods.(i am punished.
 They have stolen into recent lands
 the flower
            with their enormous fingers unwished
