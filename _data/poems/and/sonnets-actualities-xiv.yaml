 the ivory performing rose

 of you, worn upon my mind
 all night, quitting only in the unkind

 dawn its muscle amorous

 pricks with minute odour these gross
 days
      when i think of you and do not live:
 and the empty twilight cannot grieve
 nor the autumns, as i grieve,faint for your face

 O stay with me slighty.   or until

 with neat obscure obvious hands

 Time stuff the sincere stomach of each mill

 of the ingenious gods.(i am punished.
 They have stolen into recent lands
 the flower
            with their enormous fingers unwished
