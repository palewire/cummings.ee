 the mind is it own beautiful prisoner.
 Mine looked long at the sticky moon
 opening in dusk her new wings

 then decently hanged himself,one afternoon.

 The last thing he saw was you
 naked amid unnaked things,

 your flesh,a succinct wandlike animal,
 a little strolling with the futile purr
 of blood;your sex squeaked like a billiard-cue
 chalking itself,as not to make an error,
 with twists spontaneously methodical.
 He suddenly tasted worms windows and roses

 he laughed,and closed his eyes as a girl closes
 her left hand upon a mirror.
