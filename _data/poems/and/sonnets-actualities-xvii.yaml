 (let us tremble)a personal radiance sits
 hideously upon the trafficking hum
 of dusk
         each street takes of shadowy
 light the drollsnowing delirium

 (we do not speak!)
                    tumbled hushingly bits
 of downward flower flowing without or cease

 or time;a naming stealth of ectasy
 means,like a girl lasciviously frail,
                                      peace

 (dreaming is better)

                     murdering coolness slowly
 in peopling places seeks play:withs of star
 link clauses of warmth
                       (after dream who knows?)
 a blackish cat and a bluish cat are

 eyeing,as with almost melancholy
 delicacy night gargles windows.
