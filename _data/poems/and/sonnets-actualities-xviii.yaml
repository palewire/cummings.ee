                      —G O N splashes-sink
 which is east eight,a star of three annoys

 me,but the stink of perfumed noise
 fiercely mounts from the fireman’s ball,i think

 and also i think of you,getting mandolin-clink
 mixed with your hair;feeling your knees
 amoung the supercilious chimneys,

 my nerves sumptuously wink
 ....and little-dusk has his toys to play with
 windows-and-whispers,
                     (will BigMorning get away with
 them?)’m’en doute,)
                    chérie,j’m’em doute.

 —You.—in this window sits a Face
 (it is twilight)a Face playing on a flute
