 my sonnet is A light goes on in
 the toiletwindow,that’s straightacross from
 my window,night air bothered with a rustling din
 
 sort of sublimated tom-tom
 which quite outdoes the mandolin-
 
 man’s tiny racket.   The horses sleep upstairs.
 And you can see their ears.   Ears win-
 
 k,funny stable.   In the morning they go out in pairs:
 amazingly,one pair is white
 (but you know that)they look at each other.   Nudge.
 
 (if they love each other,who cares?)
 They pull the morning out of the night.
 
 I am living with a mouse who shares
 
 my meals with him,which is fair as i judge.
