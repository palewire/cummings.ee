 my sonnet is A light goes on in
 the toiletwindow,that’s straightacross from
 my window,night air bothered with a rustling din

 sort of sublimated tom-tom
 which quite outdoes the mandolin-

 man’s tiny racket.   The horses sleep upstairs.
 And you can see their ears.   Ears win-

 k,funny stable.   In the morning they go out in pairs:
 amazingly,one pair is white
 (but you know that)they look at each other.   Nudge.

 (if they love each other,who cares?)
 They pull the morning out of the night.

 I am living with a mouse who shares

 my meals with him,which is fair as i judge.
