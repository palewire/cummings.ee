 when you went away it was morning
 (this,big horses;light feeling up
 streets;heels taking derbies (where?) a pup
 hurriedly hunched over swill;one butting

 trolley imposingly empty;snickering
 shop doors unlocked by white-grub
 faces) clothes in delicate hubbub

 as you stood thinking of anything,

 maybe the world....But i have wondered since
 isn’t it odd of you really to lie
 a sharp agreeable flower between my

 amused legs
             kissing with little dints

 of april,making the obscene shy
 breasts tickle,laughing when i wilt and wince
