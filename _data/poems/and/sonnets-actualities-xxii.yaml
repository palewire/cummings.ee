 you asked me to come:it was raining a little,
 and the spring;a clumsy brightness of air
 wonderfully stumbled above the square,
 little amorous-tadpole people wiggled
 
 battered by stuttering pearl,
                              leaves jiggled
 to the jigging fragrance of newness
 —and then.   My crazy fingers liked your dress
 ....your kiss,your kiss was a distinct brittle
 
 flower,and the flesh crisp set
 my love-tooth on edge.   So until light
 each having each we promised to forget—
 
 wherefore is there nothing left to guess:
 the cheap intelligent thighs,the electric trite
 thighs;the hair stupidly priceless.
