 i like my body when it is with your
 body.    It is so quite new a thing.
 Muscles better and nerves more.
 i like your body.   i like what it does,
 i like its hows.   i like to feel the spine
 of your body and its bones,and the trembling
 -firm-smooth ness and which i will
 again and again and again
 kiss,   i like kissing this and that of you,
 i like,slowly stroking the,shocking fuzz
 of your electric fur,and what-is-it comes
 over parting flesh....And eyes big love-crumbs,

 and possibly i like the thrill

 of under me you so quite new
