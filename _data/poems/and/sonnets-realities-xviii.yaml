first_line: my girl’s tall with hard long eyes

 my girl’s tall with hard long eyes
 as she stands,with her long hard hands keeping
 silence on her dress,good for sleeping
 is her long hard body filled with surprise
 like a white shocking wire,when she smiles
 a hard long smile it sometimes makes
 gaily go clean through me tickling aches,
 and the weak noise of her eyes easily files
 my impatience to an edge—my girl’s tall
 and taut,with thin legs just like a vine
 that’s spent all of its life on a garden-wall,
 and is going to die.   When we grimly go to bed
 with these legs she begins to heave and twine
 about me,and to kiss my face and head.
