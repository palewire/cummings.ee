 she puts down the handmirror.    “Look at” arranging
 before me a mellifluous idiot grin
 (with what was nose upwrinkled into nothing
 earthly,while the slippery eyes drown
 in surging flesh).   A thumblike index down-
 dragging yanks back skin“see” (i,seeing,ceased
 to breathe).   The plump left fist opening
 “wisdom.”   Flicker of gold.   “Yep.   No gas.   Flynn”
 the words drizzle untidily from released
 cheeks “I’ll tell duh woild:some noive all right.
 Aint much on looks but how dat baby ached.”
 and when I timidly hinted “novocaine?”
 the eyes outstart,curl,bloat,are newly baked
 and swaggering cookies of indignant light
