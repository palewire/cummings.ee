 joggle i think will do it although the glad
 monosyllable jounce possibly can tell
 better how the balloons move(as
 her ghost lurks,a Beau Brummel sticking in its three-

 cornered always moist mouth)—jazz,
 for whose twitching lips,between you and me
 almost succeeds while toddle rings the bell.
 But if her tall corpsecoloured body seat
 itself(with the uncouth habitual dull
 jerk at garters)there’s no sharpest neat
 word for the thing.
                     Her voice?
                               greusome:a trull
 leaps from the lungs “gimme uh swell fite

 like up ter yknow,Rektuz,Toysday nite;
 where uh guy gets gayn troze uh lobstersalad
