 “life?
        Listen” the feline she with radishred
 legs said(crossing them slowly)“I’m
 asleep.   Yep.   Youse is asleep kid
 and everybody is.”   And i hazarded
 “god”(blushing slightly)—“O damn
 ginks like dis Gawd” opening slowlyslowly
 them—then carefully the rolypoly
 voice squatting on a mountain of gum did
 something like a whisper,“even her,”
 “The Madam?” I emitted;vaguely watching
 that mountainous worthy in the fragile act
 of doing her eyebrows.—Marj’s laughter smacked
 me:pummeling the curtains, drooped to a purr . . .

 i left her permanently smiling
