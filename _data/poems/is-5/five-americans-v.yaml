 should i entirely ask of god why
 on the alert neck of this brittle whore
 delicately wobbles an improbably distinct face,
 and how these wooden big two feet conclude
 happeningly the unfirm drooping bloated
 calves
       i would receive the answer more
 or less deserved, Young fellow go in peace.
 which i do, being as Dick Mid once noted
 lifting a Green River (here's to youse)
 "a bloke wot's well behaved" . . . and always try
 to not wonder how let's say elation
 causes the bent eyes thickly to protrudeâ€”

 or why her tiniest whispered invitation
 is like a clock striking in a dark house
