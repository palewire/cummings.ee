 touching you i say(it being Spring
 and night)“let us go a very little beyond
 the last road—there's something to be found”

 and smiling you answer“everything
 turns into something else,and slips away....
 (these leaves are Thingish with moondrool
 and i'm ever so very little afraid")
                                     i say
 “along this particular road the moon if you'll
 notice follows us like a big yellow dog.   You
 
 don't believe?   look back.(Along the sand
 behind us,a big yellow dog that’s....now it’s red
 a big red dog that may be owed by who
 knows)
       only turn a little your.   so.   And

 there's the moon, there is something faithful and mad”
