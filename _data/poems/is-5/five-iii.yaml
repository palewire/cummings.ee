 along the brittle treacherous bright streets
 of memeory comes my heart,singing like
 an idiot,whispering like a drunken man

 who(at a certain corner,suddenly)meets
 the tall policeman of my mind.
                                 awake
 being not asleep,elsewhere our dreams began
 which now are folded:but the year completes
 his life as a forgotten prisoner

 —“Ici?”—“Ah non,mon cheri;il fait trop froid”—
 they are gone:along these gardens moves a wind bringing
 rain and leaves,filling the air with fear
 and sweetness....pauses.   (Halfwhispering....halfsinging
 
 stirs the always smiling chevaux de bois)

 when you were in Paris we met here
