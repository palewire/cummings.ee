 our touching hearts slenderly comprehend
 (clinging as finders,loving one another
 gradually into hands)and bend
 into the huge disaster of the year:

 like this most early single star which tugs

 weakly at twilight,caught in the thickening fear
 our slightly fingering spirits starve and smother;
 until autumn abruptly wholly hugs

 our dying silent minds,which hand in hand
 at some window try to understand
 the
    (through pale miles of perishing air,haunted
 with huddling infinite wishless melancholy,
 suddenly looming)accurate undaunted

 moonâ€™s bright third tumblings slowly
