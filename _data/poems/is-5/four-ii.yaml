 if being morticed with a dream
 myself speaks
 
 (whispering,
 suggesting that our souls
 inhabit whatever is between them)
 knowing my lips hands the way i move
 my habits laughter

 i say
 you will perhaps pardon,
 possibly you will comprehend.   and how
 this has arrived your mind may guess

 if at sunset

 it should,leaning against me,smile;
 or(between dawn and twilight)giving

 your eyes,present me also
 with the terror of shrines

 which noone has suspected(but
 wherein silently
 always
 are kneeling the various deaths
 which are your lover lady:together with what keen
 innumerable lives he has not lived.z
