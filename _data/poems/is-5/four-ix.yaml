 supposing i dreamed this)
 only imagine,when day has thrilled
 you are a house around which
 i am a wind—
 
 your walls will not reckon how
 strangely my life is curved
 since the best he can do
 is to peer through windows,unobserved

 —listen,for(out of all
 things)dream is noone’s fool;
 if this wind who i am prowls
 carefully around this house of you
 
 love being such,or such,
 the normal corners of your heart
 will never guess how much
 my wonderful jealousy is dark
 
 if light should flower:
 or laughing sparkle from
 the shut house(around and around
 which a poor wind will roam
