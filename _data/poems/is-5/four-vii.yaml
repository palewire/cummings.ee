 since feeling is first
 who pays any attention 
 to the syntax of things
 will never wholly kiss you;
 
 wholly to be a fool
 while Spring is in the world
 
 my blood approves,
 and kisses are a better fate 
 than wisdom
 lady i swear by all flowers.  Don't cry
 —the best gesture of my brain is less than
 your eyelids’ flutter which says
 
 we are for each other:then
 laugh,leaning back in my arms
 for life’s not a paragraph
 
 And death i think is no parenthesis
