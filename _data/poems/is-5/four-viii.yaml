first_line: some ask praise of their fellows

text: |-1
 some ask praise of their fellows
 but i being otherwise
 made compose curves
 and yellows,angles or silences
 to a less erring end)
 
 myself is sculptor of
 your body’s idiom:
 the musician of your wrists;
 the poet who is afraid
 only to mistranslate
 
 a rhythm in your hair,
 (your fingertips
 the way you move)
                 the
 
 painter of your voice—
 beyond these elements
 
 remarkably nothing is....therefore,lady
 am i content should any
 by me carven thing provoke
 your gesture possibly or
 
 any painting(for its own
 
 reason)in your lips
 slenderly should create one least smile
 (shyly
 if a poem should lift to
 me the distinct country of your
 eves,gifted with green twilight)
