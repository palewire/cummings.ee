first_line: you are like the snow only

nowrap: true

 you are like the snow only
 purer fleeter,like the rain
 only sweeter frailer you

 whom certain
 flowers ressemble but trembling(cowards
 which fear
 to miss within your least gesture the hurting
 skill which lives)and since

 nothing lingers
 beyond a little instant,
 along with rhyme and with laughter
 O my lady
 (and every brittle marvelous breathing thing)

 since i and you are on our ways to dust

 of your fragility
 (but chiefly of your smile,
 most suddenly which is
 of love and death a marriage)you give me

 courage
 so that against myself
 the sharp days slobber in vain:

 Nor am i afraid that
 this,which we call autumn,cleverly
 dies and over the ripe world wanders with
 a near and careful
 smile in his mouth(making

 everything suddenly old and with his awkward eyes
 pushing
 sleep under and thoroughly
 into all beautiful things)

 winter,whom Spring shall kill
