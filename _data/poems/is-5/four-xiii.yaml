first_line: Nobody wears a yellow

nowrap: true

 Nobody wears a yellow
 flower in his buttonhole
 he is altogether a queer fellow
 as young as he is old

 when autumn comes
 who twiddles his white thumbs
 and frisks down the boulevards

 without his coat and hat

 â€”(and i wonder just why that
 should please him or i wonder what he does)

 and why (at the bottom of this trunk,
 under some dirty collars)only a
 moment
 (or
 was it perhaps a year)ago I found staring
 
 me in the face a dead yellow small rose
