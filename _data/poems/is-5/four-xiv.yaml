 it is so long since my heart has been with yours
 
 shut by our mingling arms through
 a darkness where new lights begin and
 increase,
 since your mind has walked into
 my kiss as a stranger
 into the streets and colours of a town—

 that i have perhaps forgotten
 how,always(from
 these hurrying crudites
 of blood and flesh)Love
 coins His most gradual gesture,

 and whittles life to eternity

 —after which our separating selves become museums
 filled with skilfully stuffed memories
