first_line: if within tonight’s erect

text: |-1
 if within tonight’s erect
 everywhere of black muscles fools
 a weightless slowness(deftly

 muting the world’s texture with drifted

 gifts of featheriest slenderness and
 how gradually which descending are suddenly
 received)or by doomfull connivance

 accurately thither and hither myself

 struts unremembered(rememberingly 
 with in both pockets curled hands moves)
 why then toward morning he is a ghost whom

 assault these whispering fists of hail

 (and a few windows awaken certain faces
 busily horribly blunder through new light
 hush we are made of the same thing as perhaps

 nothing,he murmurs carefully lying down)
