 i go to this window
 just as day dissolves
 when it is twilight(and
 looking up in fear
 
 I see the new moon
 thinner than a hair)
 
 making me feel
 how myself has been coarse and dull
 compared with you,silently who are 
 and cling
 to my mind always
 
 But now she sharpens and becomes crisper
 until I smile with knowing 
 â€”and all about
 herself
 
 the sprouting largest final air
 
 plunges
         inward with hurled
 downward thousands of enormous dreams
