 nobody loses all the time

 i had an uncle named
 Sol who was a born a failure and
 nearly everbody said he should have gone
 into vaudeville perhaps because my Uncle Sol could
 sing McCann He Was A Diver on Xmas Eve like Hell Itself which
 may or may not account for the fact that my Uncle

 Sol indulged in that possibly most inexcusable
 of all to use highfalootin phrase
 luxuries that is or to
 wit farming and be
 it needlessly
 added

 my Uncle Sol’s farm
 failed because the chickens
 ate the vegetables so
 my Uncle Sol had a
 chicken farm till the
 skunks ate the chickens when

 my Uncle Sol
 had a skunk farm but
 the skunks caught cold and
 died and so
 my Uncle Sol imitated the
 skunks in a subtle manner

 or by drowning himself in the watertank
 but somebody who’d given my Uncle Sol a Victor
 Victrola and records while he lived presented to
 him upon the auspicious occasion of his decease a
 scrumptious not to mend splendiferous funeral with
 tall boys in black gloves and flowers and everything and

 i remember we all cried like the Missouri
 when my Uncle Sol’s coffin lurched because
 somebody pressed a button
 (and down went
 my Uncle
 Sol

 and started a worm farm)
