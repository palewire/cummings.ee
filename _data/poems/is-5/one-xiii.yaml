 have no imagination)or never
 never to wonder about guys used to(and them
 slim hot queens with dam next to nothing

 (while a feller tries
 to hold down the fifty bucks per
 job with one foot and rock a

 cradle with the other)it Must be
 nice never to have no doubts about why you
 put the ring
 on(and watching her
 face grow old and tired to which

 you’re married and hands get red washing
 things and dishes)and to never,never really wonder i
 mean about the smell
 of babies and how you

 know the dam rent’s going to and everything and never,never
 Never to stand at no window
 because i can’t sleep(smoking sawdust

 cigarettes in the
 middle of the night
