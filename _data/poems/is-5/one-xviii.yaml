 why are these pipples taking their hets off?
 the king & queen
 alighting from their limousine
 inhabit the Hôtel Meurice(whereas
 i live in a garret and eat aspirine)

 but who is this pale softish almost round
 young man to whom headwaiters bow so?
 hush — the author of Women By Night whose latest Seeds
 Of Evil sold 69 carloads before
 publication the girl who goes wrong you

 know(whereas when i lie down i cough too
 much).   How did The traffic get so jammed?
 bedad it is the famous doctor who inserts
 monkeyglands in millionaires a cute idea n‘est-ce pas? 
 (whereas,upon the other hand,myself) but let us next demand

 wherefore yon mob
 an accident?somebody got concus-
 sion of the brain?—Not
 a bit of it,my dears merely the prime
 minister of Siam in native

 costume,who
 emerging from a pissoir
 enters abruptly Notre Dame(whereas
 de gustibus non disputandum est
 my lady is tired of That sort of thing
