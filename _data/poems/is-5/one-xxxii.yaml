 a man who had fallen among thieves
 lay by the roadside on his back
 dressed in fifteenthrate ideas
 wearing a round jeer for a hat
 
 fate per a somewhat more than less
 emancipated evening
 had in return for consciousness
 endowed him with a changeless grin
 
 whereon a dozen staunch and leal
 citizens did graze at pause
 then fired by hypercivic zeal
 sought newer pastures or because
 
 swaddled with a frozen brook
 of pinkest vomit out of eyes
 which noticed nobody he looked
 as if he did not care to rise
 
 one hand did nothing on the vest
 its wideflung friend clenched weakly dirt
 while the mute trouserfly confessed
 a button solemnly inert
 
 Brushing from whom the stiffened puke
 i put him all into my arms
 and staggered hanged with terror through
 a million billion trillion stars
