 voices to voices,lip to lip
 i swear(to noone everyone) constitutes
 undying; or whatever this and that petal confutes...
 to exist begin a peculiar form of sleep

 what's beyond logic happens beneath will;
 nor can these moments be translated:i say
 that even after April
 by God there is no excuse for May

 —bring forth your flowers and machinery:sculpture and prose
 flowers guess and miss
 machinery is the more accurate,yes
 it delivers the goods,Heaven knows

 (yet are. we mindful,though not as yet awake,
 of ourselves which shout and cling,bing
 for a little while and which easily break
 in spite of the best overseeing)

 i mean that the blond absence of any program
 except last and always and first to live
 makes unimportant what i and you believe;
 not for philosophy does this rose give a damn...

 bring on your fireworks, which are a mixed
 splendor of piston and of pistil;very well
 provided an instant may be fixed
 so that it will not rub,like any other pastel.
