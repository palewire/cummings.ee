 poets yeggs and thirsties

 since we are spanked and put to sleep by dolls let
 us not be continually astonished should
 from their actions and speeches
 sawdust perpetually leak

 rather it is between such beddings and
 bumpings of ourselves to be observed
 how in this fundamental respect the well
 recognized regime of childhood is reversed

 meantime in dreams let us investigate
 thoroughly each one his optima rerum first
 having taken care to lie upon our
 abdomens for greater privacy and lest

 punished bottoms interrupt philosophy
