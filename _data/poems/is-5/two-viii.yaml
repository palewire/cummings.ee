 come,gaze with me upon this dome
 of many coloured glass,and see
 his mother’s pride,his father’s joy,
 unto whom duty whispers low

 “thou must!” and who replies “I can!”
 —yon clean upstanding well dressed boy
 that with his peers full oft hath quaffed
 the wine of life and found it sweet—

 a tear within his stern blue eye,
 upon his firm white lips a smile,
 one thought alone:to do or die
 for God for country and for Yale

 above his blond determined head
 the sacred flag of truth unfurled,
 in the bright heyday of his youth
 the upper class American

 unsullied stands,before the world:
 with manly heart and conscience free,
 upon the front steps of her home
 by the high minded pure young girl

 much kissed,by loving relatives
 well fed,and fully photographed
 the son of man goes forth to war
 with trumpets clap and syphilis
