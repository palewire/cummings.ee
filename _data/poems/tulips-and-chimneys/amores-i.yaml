 consider O
 woman this
 my body.
 for it has

 lain
 with empty arms
 upon the giddy hills
 to dream of you,

 approve these
 firm unsated
 eyes
 which have beheld

 nightâ€™s speechless carnival
 the painting
 of the dark
 with meteors

 streaming from playful
 immortal hands
 the bursting
 of the wafted stars

 (in time to come you shall
 remember of this night amazing
 esctasies    slowly,
 in the glutted

 heart fleet
 flowerterrible
 memories
 shall

 rise,slowly
 return upon the
                red elected lips

 scaleless visions)
