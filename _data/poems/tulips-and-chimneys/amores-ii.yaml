 there is a
 moon sole
 in the blue
 night

      amorous of waters
 tremulous,
 blinded with silence the
 undulous heaven yearns where

 in tense starlessness
 anoint with ardor
 the yellow lover

 stands in the dumb dark
 svelte
 and
 urgent

        (again
 love i slowly
 gather
 of thy languorous mouth the

 thrilling
 flower)
