 as is the sea marvelous
 from godâ€™s
 hands which sent her forth
 to sleep upon the world

 and the earth withers
 the moon crumbles
 one by one
 stars flutter into dust

 but the sea
 does not change
 and she goes forth out of hands and
 she returns into hands

 and is with sleep....

 love,
      the breaking

 of your
         soul
         upon
 my lips
