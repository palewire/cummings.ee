 if i believe
 in death be sure
 of this
 it is

 because you have loved me,
 moon and sunset
 stars and flowers
 gold crescendo and silver muting

 of seatides
 i trusted not,
               one night
 when in my fingers

 drooped your shining body
 when my heart
 sang between your perfect
 breasts

 darkness and beauty of stars
 was on my mouth petals danced
 against my eyes
 and down

 the singing reaches of
 my soul
 spoke
 the green-

 greeting pale-
 departing irrevocable
 sea
 i knew thee death.

                   and when
 i have offered up each fragrant
 night,when all my days
 shall have before a certain

 face become
 white
 perfume
 only,

      from the ashes
 then
 thou wilt rise and thou
 wilt come to her and brush

 the mischief from her eyes and fold
 her
 mouth the new
 flower with

 thy unimaginable
 wings, where dwells the breath
 of all persisting stars
