text: |-1
 the glory is fallen out of
 the sky the last immortal
 leaf
 is

 dead and the gold
 year
 a formal spasm
 in the

 dust
 this is the passing of all shining things
 therefore we also
 blandly

 into receptive
 earth,O let
 us
 descend

 take
 shimmering wind
 these fragile splendors from
 us crumple them hide

 them in they breath drive
 them in nothingness
 for we
 would sleep

 this is the passing of all shining things
 no lingering no backward-
 wondering be unto
 us O

 soul,but straight
 glad feet fearruining
 and glorygirded
 faces

 lead us
 into the
 serious
 steep

 darkness
