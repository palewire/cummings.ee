text: |-1
 the glory is fallen out of
 the sky the last immortal
 leaf
 is
 
 dead and the gold
 year
 a formal spasm
 in the
 
 dust
 this is the passing of all shining things
 therefore we also
 blandly
 
 into receptive
 earth,O let
 us
 descend
 
 take
 shimmering wind
 these fragile splendors from
 us crumple them hide
 
 them in they breath drive
 them in nothingness
 for we
 would sleep
 
 this is the passing of all shining things
 no lingering no backward-
 wondering be unto
 us O
 
 soul,but straight
 glad feet fearruining
 and glorygirded
 faces
 
 lead us
 into the
 serious
 steep
 
 darkness
