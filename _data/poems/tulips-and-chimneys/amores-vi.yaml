 i like
 to think that on
 the flower you gave me when we
 loved

      the far-
 departed mouth sweetly-saluted
 lingers.
         if one marvel

 seeing the hunger of my
 lips for a dead thing,
 i shall instruct
 him silently with becoming

 steps to seek
 your face    and i
 entreat,by certain foolish perfect
 hours

      dead too,
 if that he come receive
 him as your lover sumptuously
 being

 kind
      because i trust him to
 your grace,and for
 in his own land

 he is called death.
