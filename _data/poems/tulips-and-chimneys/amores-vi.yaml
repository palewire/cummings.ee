 i like
 to think that on
 the flower you gave me when we
 loved
 
      the far-
 departed mouth sweetly-saluted
 lingers.
         if one marvel
 
 seeing the hunger of my
 lips for a dead thing,
 i shall instruct
 him silently with becoming
 
 steps to seek
 your face    and i
 entreat, by certain foolish perfect
 hours
 
      dead too,
 if that he come receive
 him as your lover sumptuously
 being
 
 kind
     because i trust him to
 your grace, and for
 in his own land
 
 he is called death.
