 O Distinct
 Lady of my unkempt adoration
 if i have made
 a fragile certain
 
 song under the window of your soul
 it is not like any songs
 (the singers the others
 they have been faithful
 
 to many things and which
 die
 i have been sometimes true
 to Nothing and which lives
 
 they were fond of the handsome
 moon     never spoke ill of the
 pretty stars     and to
 the serene the complicated
 
 and the obvious
 they were faithful
 and which I despise,
 frankly
 
 admitting i have been true
 only to the noise of worms
 in the eligible day
 under the unaccountable sun)
 
 Distinct Lady
 swiftly take
 my fragile certain song
 that we may watch together
 
 how behind the doomed
 exact smile of life’s
 placid obscure palpable
 carnival where to a normal
 
 melody of probable violins dance
 the square virtues and the oblong sins
 perfectly
 gesticulate the accurate
 
 strenuous lips of incorruptible
 Nothing     under the ample
 sun, under the insufficient
 day under the noise of worms
