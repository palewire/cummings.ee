 O Distinct
 Lady of my unkempt adoration
 if i have made
 a fragile certain

 song under the window of your soul
 it is not like any songs
 (the singers the others
 they have been faithful

 to many things and which
 die
 i have been sometimes true
 to Nothing and which lives

 they were fond of the handsome
 moon     never spoke ill of the
 pretty stars     and to
 the serene the complicated

 and the obvious
 they were faithful
 and which I despise,
 frankly

 admitting i have been true
 only to the noise of worms.
 in the eligible day
 under the unaccountable sun)

 Distinct Lady
 swiftly take
 my fragile certain song
 that we may watch together

 how behind the doomed
 exact smile of lifeâ€™s
 placid obscure palpable
 carnival where to a normal

 melody of probable violins dance
 the square virtues and the oblong sins
 perfectly
 gesticulate the accurate

 strenuous lips of incorruptible
 Nothing     under the ample
 sun,under the insufficient
 day under the noise of worms
