 Thou aged unreluctant earth who dost
 with quivering continual thighs invite
 the thrilling rain the slender paramour
 to toy with they extraordinary lust,
 (the sinuous rain which rising from thy bed
 steals to his wife the sky and hour by hour
 wholly renews her pale flesh with delight)
 —immortally whence are the high gods fled?
 
 Speak elm eloquent pandar with thy nod
 significant to the ecstatic earth
 in token of his coming whom her soul
 burns to embrace—and didst thou know the god
 from but the imprint of whose cloven feet
 the shrieking dryad sought her leafy goal,
 at the mere echo of whose shining mirth
 the furious hearts of mountains ceased to beat?
 
 Wind beautifully who wanderest
 over smooth pages of forgotten joy
 proving the peaceful theorems of the flowers
 —didst e'er depart upon more exquisite quest?
 and did they fortunate fingers sometime dwell
 (within a greener shadow of secret bowers)
 amoung the curves of that delicious boy
 whose serious grace one goddes loved too well?
 
 Chryselephantine Zeus Olympian
 sceptred colossus of the Pheidian soul
 whose eagle frights creation, in whose palm
 Nike presents the crown sweetest to man,
 whose lilied robe the sun’s white hands emboss,
 betwixt whose absolute feet anoint with calm
 of intent stars circling the acerb pole
 poises, smiling, the diadumenos
 
 in whose young chiseled eyes the people saw
 their once again victorious Pantarkes
 (whose grace the prince of artists made him bold
 to imitate between the feet of aw),
 thunderer whose omnipotent brow showers
 its curls of unendured eternal gold
 over the infinite breast in bright degrees,
 whose pillow is the graces and the hours,
 
 father of gods and men whose subtle throne
 twain sphinxes bear each with a writhing youth
 caught to her brazen breasts, whose foot-stool tells
 how fought the looser of the warlike zone
 of her that brought forth tall Hippolytus,
 lord on whose pedestal the deep expels
 (over Selene’s car closing uncouth)
 of Helios the sweet wheels tremulous—
 
 are there no kings in Argos, that the song
 is silent, of the steep unspeaking tower
 within whose brightening strictness Danæ
 saw the night severed and the glowing throng
 descend, felt on her flesh the amorous strain
 of gradual hands and yielding to that fee
 her eager body's unimmortal flower
 knew in the darkness a more burning rain?

 And still the mad magnificent herald Spring
 assembles beauty from forgetfulness
 with the wild trump of April: witchery
 of sound and odour drives the wingless thing
 man forth into bright air, for now the red
 leaps in the maple’s cheek, and suddenly
 by shining hordes in sweet unserious dress
 ascends the golden crocus from the dead.
 
 On dappled dawn forth rides the pungent sun
 with hooded day preening upon his hand
 followed by gay untimid final flowers
 (which dressed in various tremulous armor stun
 the eyes of the ragged earth who sees them pass)
 while hunted from his kingdom winter cowers,
 seeing green armies steadily expand
 hearing the spear-song of the marching grass.
 
 A silver sudden parody of snow
 tickles the air to golden tears, and hark!
 the flicker’s laughing yet, while on the hills
 the pines deepen to whispers primeval and throw
 backward their foreheads to the barbarous bright
 sky, and suddenly from the valley thrills
 the unimaginable upward lark
 and drowns the earth and passes into light
 
 (slowly in life’s serene perpetual round
 a pale world gathers comfort to her soul,
 hope richly scattered by the abundant sun
 invades the new mosaic of the ground
 —let but the incurious curtaining dusk be drawn
 surpassing nets are sedulously spun
 to snare the brutal dew,—the authentic scroll
 of fairie hands and vanishing of the dawn).
 
 Spring, that omits no mention of desire
 in every curved and curling thing, yet holds
 continous intercourse—through skies and trees
 the lilac’s smoke the poppy’s pompous fire
 the pansy’s purple patience and the grave
 frailty of daisies—by what rare unease
 revealed of teasingly transparent folds—
 with man’s poor soul superlatively brave.
 
 Surely from robes of particoloured peace
 with mouth flower-faint and undiscovered eyes
 and dim slow perfect body amorous
 (whiter than lilies which are born and cease
 for being whiter than this world) exhales
 the hovering high perfume curious
 of that one month for whom the whole year dies,
 risen at length from palpitating veils.
 
 O still miraculous May! O shining girl
 of time untarnished! O small intimate
 gently primeval hands, frivolous feet
 divine! O singular and breathless pearl!
 O indefinable frail ultimate pose!
 O visible beatitude sweet sweet
 intolerable! silence immaculate
 of god’s evasive audible great rose!

 Lover, lead forth they love unto that bed
 prepared by whitest hands of waiting years,
 curtained with wordless worship absolute,
 unto the certain altar at whose head
 stands the clear candle whose expecting breath
 exults upon the tongue of flame half-mute,
 (haste e’er some thrush with silver several tears
 complete the perfumed paraphrase of death).
 
 Now is the time when all occassional things
 close into silence, only one tree, one
 svelte translation of eternity
 unto the pale meaning of heaven clings,
 (whose million leaves in winsome indolence
 simmer upon thinking twilight momently)
 as down the oblivious west’s numerous dun
 magnificence conquers magnificence.
 
 In heaven’s intolerable athanor
 inimitably tortured the base day
 utters at length her soft intrinsic hour,
 and from those tenuous fires which more and more
 sink and are lost the divine alchemist,
 the magus of creation, lifts a flower—
 whence is the world’s insufferable clay
 clothed with incognizable amethyst.
 
 Lady at whose imperishable smile
 the amazed doves flicker upon sunny wings
 as if in terror of eternity,
 (or seeming that they would msitrust a while
 the moving of beauteous dead mouths throughout
 that very proud transparent company
 of quivering ghosts-of-love which scarcely sings
 drifting in slow diaphanous faint rout),
 
 queen in the inconceivable embrace
 of whose tremendous hair that blossom stands
 whereof is most desire, yet less than those
 twain perfect roses whose ambrosial grace,
 goddess, they crippled thunder-forging groom
 of the loud lord of skipping mænads knows,—
 having Discordia’s apple in thy hands,
 which the scared shepherd gave thee for his doom—
 
 O thou within the chancel of whose charms
 the tall boy god of everlasting war
 received the shuddering sacrament of sleep,
 betwixt whose cool incorrigible arms
 impaled upon delicious mystery,
 with gaunt limbs reeking of the whispered deep,
 deliberate groping ocean fondled o’er
 the warm long flower of unchastity,
 
 imperial Cytherea, from frail foam
 sprung with irrevocable nakedness
 to strike the young world into smoking song—
 as the first star perfects the sensual dome
 of darkness, and the sweet strong final bird
 transcends the sight, O thou to whom belong
 the hearts of lovers!—I beseech thee bless
 thy suppliant singer and his wandering word.
