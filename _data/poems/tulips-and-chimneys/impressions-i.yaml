title: Impressions I

first_line: the sky a silver

text: |-1
 the sky a silver
 dissonance by the correct
 fingers of April
 resolved

          into a
 clutter of trite jewels

 now like a moth with stumbling

 wings flutters and flops along the
 grass collides with trees and
 houses and finally,
 butts into the river
