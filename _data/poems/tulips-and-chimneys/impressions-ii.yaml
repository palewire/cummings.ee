 write and
 gape of tortured
 
  perspective
  rasp and graze of splintered
 
 normality
           crackle and
           sag
  of planes     clamors of
  collision
  collapse     As
 
 peacefully,
 lifted
 into the awful beauty
                       of sunset
 
                       the young city
 putting off dimension with a blush
 enters
 the becoming garden of her agony
