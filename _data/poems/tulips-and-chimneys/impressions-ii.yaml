 writhe and
 gape of tortured

   perspective
   rasp and graze of splintered

 normality
           crackle and
           sag
  of planes      clamors of
  collision
  collapse      As

 peacefully,
 lifted
 into the awful beauty
                       of sunset

                       the young city
 putting off dimension with a blush
 enters
 the becoming garden of her agony
