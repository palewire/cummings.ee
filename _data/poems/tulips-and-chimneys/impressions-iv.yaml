 the hours rise up putting off stars and it is
 dawn
 into the street of the sky light walks scattering poems
 
 on earth a candle is
 extinguished     the city
 wakes
 with a song upon her
 mouth having death in her eyes
 
 and it is dawn
 the world
 goes forth to murder dreams ....
 
 i see in the street where strong
 men are digging bread
 and i see the brutal faces of
 people contented hideous hopeless cruel happy
 
 and it is day,
 
 in the mirror
 i see a frail
 man
 dreaming
 dreams
 
 dreams in the mirror
 
 and it
 is dush    on earth
 
 a candle is lighted
 and it is dark.
 the people are in their houses
 the frail main is in his bed
 the city
 
 sleeps with death upon her mouth having a song in her eyes
 the hours descend,
 putting on stars....
 
 in the street of the sky night walks scattering poems
