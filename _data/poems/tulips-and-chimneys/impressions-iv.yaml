 the hours rise up putting off stars and it is
 dawn
 into the street of the sky light walks scattering poems

 on earth a candle is
 extinguished       the city
 wakes
 with a song upon her
 mouth having death in her eyes

 and it is dawn
 the world
 goes forth to murder dreams....

 i see in the street where strong
 men are digging bread
 and i see the brutal faces of
 people contented hideous hopeless cruel happy

 and it is day,

 in the mirror
 i see a frail
 man
 dreaming
 dreams
 dreams in the mirror

 and it
 is dusk    on earth

 a candle is lighted
 and it is dark.
 the people are in their houses
 the frail main is in his bed
 the city

 sleeps with death upon her mouth having a song in her eyes
 the hours descend,
 putting on stars....

 in the street of the sky night walks scattering poems
