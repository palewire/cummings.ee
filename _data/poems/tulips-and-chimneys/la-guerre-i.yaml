 the bigness of cannon
 is skilful,

 but i have seen
 deathâ€™s clever enormous voice
 which hides in a fragility
 of poppies....

 i say that sometimes
 on these long talkative animals
 are laid fists of huger silence.

 I have seen all the silence
 filled with vivid noiseless boys

 at Roupy
 i have seen
 between barrages,

 the night utter ripe unspeaking girls.
