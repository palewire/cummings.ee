 O sweet spontaneous
 earth how often have
 the
 doting

       fingers of
 prurient philosphers pinched
 and
 poked

 thee
 ,has the naughty thumb
 of science prodded
 thy

    beauty     .how
 often have religions taken
 thee upon their scraggy knees
 squeezing and

 buffeting thee that thou mightest conceive
 gods
     (but
 true

 to the incomparable
 couch of death thy
 rhythmic
 lover

      thou answerest

 them only with

                spring)
