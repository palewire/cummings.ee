 O sweet spontaneous
 earth how often have
 the
 doting
 
       fingers of
 prurient philosphers pinched
 and
 poked
 
 thee
 , has the naughty thumb
 of science prodded
 thy
 
    beauty     . how
 often have religions taken
 thee upon their scraggy knees
 squeezing and
 
 buffeting thee that thou mightest conceive
 gods
     (but
 true
 
 to the incomparable
 couch of death thy
 rhythmic
 lover
 
      thou answerest
 
 
 
 them only with
 
                spring)
