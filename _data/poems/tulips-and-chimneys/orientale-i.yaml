first_line: i spoke to thee

text: |-1
 i spoke to thee
 with a smile and thou didst not
 answer
 thy mouth is as
 a chord of crimson music
                          Come hither
 O thou,is life not a smile?

 i spoke to thee with
 a song and thou
 didst not listen
 thine eyes are as a vase
 of divine silence
                   Come hither
 O thou,is life not a song?

 i spoke
 to thee with a soul and
 thou didst not wonder
 thy face is as a dream locked
 in white fragrance
                    Come hither
 O thou,is life not love?

 i speak to
 thee with a sword
 and thou art silent
 thy breast is as a tomb
 softer than flowers
                     Come hither
 O thou,is love not death?
