 my love
 thy hair is one kingdom
   the king whereof is darkness
 thy forehead is a flight of flowers
 
 
 they head is a quick forest
 filled with sleeping birds
 thy breasts are swarms of white bees
   upon the bough of thy body
 thy body to me is April
 in whose armpits is the approach of spring
 
 
 thy thighs are white horses yoked to a chariot
    of kings
 they are the striking of a good minstrel
 between them is always a pleasant song
 
 
 my love
 thy head is a casket
   of the cool jewel of thy mind
 the hair of thy head is one warrior
   innocent of defeat
 thy hair upon thy shoulders is an army
   with victory and with trumpets
 thy legs are the trees of dreaming
 whose fruit is the very eatage of forgetfulness
 
 
 thy lips are satraps in scarlet
   in whose kiss is the combining of kings
 thy wrists
 are holy
   which are the keepers of the keys of thy blood
 thy feet upon thy ankles are flowers in vases
   of silver
   
   
 in thy beauty is the dilemma of flutes
 
   thy eyes are the betrayal
 of hells comprehended through incense
