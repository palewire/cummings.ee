 listen
 beloved
 i dreamed
   it appeared that you thought to
   escape me and become a great
   lily atilt on
   insolent
   waters       but i was aware of
   fragrance and i came riding upon
   a horse of porphyry    into the
   water i rode down the red
   horse shrieking   from splintering
   foam caught you clutched you upon my
   mouth
 listen
 beloved
   i dreamed     in my dream you had
   desire to thwart me and became
   a little bird and hid
   in a tree of tall marble
   from a great way i distinguished
   singing and i came
   riding upon a scarlet sunset
   trampling the night      easily
   from the shocked impossible
   tower i caught
   you strained you
   broke you upon my blood
 listen
   beloved i dreamed
   i thought you would have deceived
   me and become a star in the kingdom
   of heaven
   through day and space i saw you close
   your eyes    and i came riding
   upon a thousand crimson years arched with agony
   i reined them in tottering before
   the throne and as
   they shied at the automaton moon from
   the transplendent hand of sombre god
   i picked you
 as an apple is picked by the little peasants for their girls
