 unto thee i
 burn incense
 the bowl crackles
 upon the gloom arise purple pencils

 fluent spires of frangrance
 the bowl
 seethes
 a flutter of stars

 a turbulence of forms
 delightful with indefinable flowering,
 the air is
 deep with desirable flowers

 i think
 thou lovest incense
 for in the ambigious faint aspirings
 the indolent frail ascensions,

 of thy smile rises the immaculate
 sorrow
 of thy low
 hair flutter the level litanies

 unto thee i burn
 incense,over the dim smoke
 straining my lips are vague with
 ectasy my palpitating breasts inhale the

 slow
 supple
 flower
 of thy beauty,my heart discovers thee

 unto
 whom i
 burn
 olbanum
