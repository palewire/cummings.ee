 1.

 the emperor
 sleeps in a palace of porphyry
 which was a million years building
 he takes the air in howdah
 of jasper beneath saffron
 umbrellas
 upon an elephant
 twelve feet high
 behind whose ear
 sits always a crowned
 king twir-
 ling an
 ankus of
 ebony
 the fountains of the emperor’s
 palace run sunlight and
 moonlight and the emperor’s
 elephant is a thousand years old

 the harem of
 the emperor
 is carpeted with
 gold cloth
 from the
 ceiling(one
 diamond timid
 with nesting incense)
 fifty
 marble
 pillars
 slipped from immeasurable
 height,fall,fifty,silent

 in the incense is tangled a cool moon
 there are thrice-three-hundred
 doors carven of chalcendony and
 before every door a naked
 eunuch watches
 on their heads turbans of a hundred
 colours
 in their hands scimitars like windy torches
 each
 is
 blacker than oblivion

 the ladies
 of the emperor’s
 harem are queens
 of all the earth and the rings
 upon their hands are from mines
 a mile deep
 but the body of
 the queen of queens is
 more transparent
 than water,she is softer than birds

 2.

 when the emperor is very
 amorous he reclines upon
 the couch of couches and
 beckons      with
 the little
 finger of his left
 hand
 then the
 thrice-three-hundredth
 door is opened by the tallest
 eunuch and the queen
 of queens comes
 forth
 ankles
 musical with large pearls
 kingdoms in her ears
 at the feet of
 the emperor a cithern-
 player squats with
 quiveringgold
 body
 behind
 the emperor ten
 elected warriors with
 bodies of lazy jade
 and twitching
 eyelids
 finger
 their
 unquiet
 spears

 the queen of queens is dancing

 her subtle
 body weaving
 insinuating upon the gold cloth
 incessantly creates patterns of sudden
 lust
 her
 stealing body ex-
 pending gathering pouring upon itself     stiffenS
 to a
 white thorn
 of desire

 the taut neck of the citharede wags
 in the dust the ghastly warriors
 amber with lust breathe
 together    the emperor,exerting
 himself amoung his pillows throws
 jewels at the queen of queens and
 white money upon her nakedness
 he
 nods
          and all
 depart through the bruised air aflutter with pearls

 3.

 they are
 alone
 he beckons,she rises she
 stands
 a moment
 in the passion of the fifty
 pillars
 listening

 while the queens of all the
 earth writhe upon deep rugs
