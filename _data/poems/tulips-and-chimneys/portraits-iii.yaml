 between nose-red gross
 walls    sprawling with tipsy
 tables the abominable
 floor belches smoky

 laughter into the filigree
 frame of a microscope
 stage whose jouncing curtain.    ,rises
 upon one startling doll

 undressed in unripe green with
 nauseous spiderlegs
 and excremental
 hair and the eyes of the mother of

 god who spits seeds of dead
 song about home and love from her
 transfigured face a queer
 pulp of ecstacy

 while in the battered
 bodies the odd unlovely
 souls struggle    slowly    and    writhe
 like caught.brave:flies;
