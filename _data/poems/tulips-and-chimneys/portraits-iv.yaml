 i walked the boulevard
 
 i saw a dirty child
 skating on noisy wheels of joy
 
 pathetic dress fluttering
 
 
 behind her a mothermonster
 with red grumbling face
 
 cluttered in pursuit
 
 pleasantly elephantine
 
 
 while nearby the father
 
 a thick cheerful man
 
 with majestic bulbous lips
 and forlorn piggish hands
 
 
 joked to a girlish whore
 
 with buy rhythmic mouth
 and silly purple eyelids
 
 of how she was with child
