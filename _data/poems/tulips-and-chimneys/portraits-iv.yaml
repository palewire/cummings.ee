 i walked the boulevard

 i saw a dirty child
 skating on noisy wheels of joy

 pathetic dress fluttering


 behind her a mothermonster
 with red grumbling face

 cluttered in pursuit

 pleasantly elephantine


 while nearby the father

 a thick cheerful man

 with majestic bulbous lips
 and forlorn piggish hands


 joked to a girlish whore

 with buy rhythmic mouth
 and silly purple eyelids

 of how she was with child
