 the young
 man sitting
 in Dick Mid’s Place
 said to Death
 
 teach me of her
 Thy yonder servant who
 in Thy very house silently
 sits looking beyond the
 
 kissing and striving of
 that old man who at her
 redstone mouth renews his
 childhood
 
 and He
 said
 “willingly
 for the tale is short
 
 it was
 i think yourself delivered into
 both my hands herself to
 always keep”
 
 always?
 the young
 man sitting in Dick Mid’s
 Place
 
 asked
 “always”
 Death
 said
 
 “then as i recollect her
 girlhood was by the kindly
 lips and body fatherly of a
 romantic tired business man
 
 somewhat tweaked and dinted
 then
 did my servant
 become of the company of those
 
 ladies with faces painteaten
 and bodies lightly
 desperate certainly wherefrom
 departed is youth’s indispensable
 
 illusion”
