 but the other
 day i was passing a certain
 fate,     rain
 fell(as it will

 in spring)
 ropes
 of silver gliding from sunny
 thunder into freshness

 as if godâ€™s flowers were
 pulling upon bells of
 gold    i looked
 up

 and
 thought to myself     Death
 and will You with
 elaborate fingers possibly touch

 the pink hollyhock existence whose
 pansy eyes look from morning till
 night into the street
 unchangingly      the always

 old lady always sitting in her
 gentle window like
 a reminiscence
 partaken

 softly    at whose gate smile
 always the chosen
 flowers of reminding
