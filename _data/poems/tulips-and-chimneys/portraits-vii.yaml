 the rose
 is dying the
 lips of an old man murder

 the petals
 hush
 mysteriously
 invisible mourners move
 with prose faces and sobbing,garments
 The symbol of the rose

 motionless
 with grieving feet and
 wings
 mounts

 against the margins of steep song
 a stallion sweetness     ,the

 lips of an old man murder

 the petals.
