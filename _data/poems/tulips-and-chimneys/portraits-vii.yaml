first_line: the rose

text: |-1
 the rose
 is dying the
 lips of an old man murder
 
 the petals
 hush
 mysteriously
 invisible mourners move
 with prose faces and sobbing,garments
 The symbol of the rose
 
 motionless
 with grieving feet and
 wings
 mounts
 
 against the margins of steep song
 a stallion sweetness     ,the
 
 lips of an old man murder
 
 the petals.
