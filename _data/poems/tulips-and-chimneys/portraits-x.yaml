 somebody knew Lincoln somebody Xerxes

 this man:a narrow thudding timeshaped face
 plus innocuous winking hands,carefully
 inhabits number 1 on something street

 Spring comes
              the lean and definite houses

 are troubled.   A sharp blue day
 fills with peacefully leaping air
 the minute mind of the world.
 The lean and

 definite houses are
 troubled.in the sunset their chimneys converse
 angrily,their
 roofs are nervous with the soft furious
 light,and while fire-escapes and
 roofs and chimneys and while roofs and fire-escapes and
 chimneys and while chimneys and fire-escapes
 and roofs are talking rapidly all together there happens
 Something,and They

 cease(and
 one by one are turned suddenly and softly
 into irresponsible toys.)
                          when this man with

 the brittle legs winces
 swiftly out of number 1 someThing
 street and trickles carefully into the park
 sits

 Down.   pigeons circle
 around and around and around the

 irresponsible toys
 circle wildly in the slow-ly-in creasing fragility
 â€”.Dogs
 bark
 children
 play
 -ing
      Are

 in the beautiful nonsense of twilight

 and somebody Napoleon
