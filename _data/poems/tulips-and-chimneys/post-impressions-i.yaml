 beyond the brittle towns asleep
 i look where stealing needles of foam
 in the last light

 thread creeping shores


 as out of dumb strong hands infinite

 the erect deep upon me
 in the last light
 pours its eyeless miles


 the chattering sunset ludicrously
 dies,i hear only tidewings

 in the last light
 twitching at the world
