 into the strenuous briefness
 Life:
 handorgans and April
 darkness,friends

 i charge laughing.
 Into the hair-thin tints
 of yellow dawn,
 into the women-coloured twilight

 i smilingly
 glide.   I
 into the big vermillion departure
 swim, sayingly;

 (Do you think?)the
 i do,world
 is probably made
 of roses & hello:

 (of solongs and,ashes)
