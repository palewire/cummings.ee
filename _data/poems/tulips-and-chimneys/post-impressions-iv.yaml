 i am going to utter a tree, Nobody
 shall stop me
 
 but first
 earth     , the reckelss oral darkness
 raging with thin impulse
 
 i will have
 
 a
    dream
    i
    think it shall be roses and
 spring will bring her
 worms rushing through loam.
 
 (afterwards i’ll
 climb
 by tall careful muscles
 
 into nervous and accurate silence .... But   first
 
 you)
 
 press easily
 at first, it will be leaves
 
 and a little harder
 for roses
 only a little harder
 
 last     we
 on the groaning flame of neat huge
 trudging kiss moistly climbing hideously with
 large
 minute
 hips, O
 
         .press
 
 worms rushing slowly through loam
