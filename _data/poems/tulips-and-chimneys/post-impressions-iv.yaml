 i am going to utter a tree,Nobody
 shall stop me

 but first
 earth     ,the reckless oral darkness
 raging with thin impulse

 i will have

 a
   dream
   i
   think it shall be roses and
 spring will bring her
 worms rushing through loam.

 (afterwards iâ€™ll
 climb
 by tall careful muscles

 into nervous and accurate silence....But   first

 you)

 press easily
 at first,it will be leaves
 and a little harder
 for roses
 only a little harder

 last     we
 on the groaning flame of neat huge
 trudging kiss moistly climbing hideously with
 large
 minute
 hips,O

         .press

 worms rushing slowly through loam
