first_line: any man is wonderful

text: |-1
 any man is wonderful
 and a formula
 a bit of tobacco and gladness
 plus little derricks of gesture

 any skyscraper
 bulges in the looseness of morning
 but in twilight becomes
 unutterably crisp

 a thing,
 which tightens
 caught
 in the hoisting light

 any woman is smooth and ridiculous
 a polite uproar of knuckling silent planes
 a nudging bulb silkenly brutal
 a devout flexion
