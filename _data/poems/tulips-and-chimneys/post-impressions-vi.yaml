 at the head of this street a gasping organ is waving moth-eaten
 tunes.   a fatish hand turns the crank;the box spouts fairies,out
 of it sour gnomes tumble clumsily,the little box is spilling ran-
 cid elves upon neat sunlight into the flowerstricken air which is
 filthy with agile swarming sonal creatures

 —Children,stand with circular frightened faces glaring at the
 shabby tiny smiling,man in whose hand the crank goes desperately,
 round and round pointing to the queer monkey

 (if you toss him a coin he will pick it cleverly from,the air and
 stuff it seriously in,his minute pocket)Sometimes he does not
 catch a piece of money and then his master will yell at him over
 the music and jerk the little string and the monkey will sit,up,
 and look at,you with his solemn blinky eyeswhichneversmile and
 after he has caught a,penny or three,pennies he will be thrown a
 peanut(which he will open skilfully with his, mouth carefully
 holding, it in his little toylikehand)and then he will stiff-ly
 throw the shell away with a small bored gesture that makes the
 children laugh.

 But i don’t,   the crank goes round desperate elves and hope-
 less gnomes and frantic fairies gush clumsily from the battered box
 fatish and mysterious the flowerstricken sunlight is thickening
 dizzily is reeling gently the street and the children and the mon-
 keyandtheorgan and the man are dancing slowly are tottering up
 and down in trembly mist of atrocious melody....tiniest dead
 tunes crawl upon my face my hair is lousy with mutilated singing
 microscopic things in my ears scramble faintly tickling putres-
 cent atomies,
              and
                  i feel the jerk of the little stringthe tiny
 smiling shabby man is yelling over the music i understand
 him i shove my round red hat back on my head i site up and
 blink at you with my solemn eyeswhichneversmile

 yes,By god.
 for i am they are pointing at the queer monkey with a little
 oldish doll-like face and hairy arms like an ogre and rubbbercolour
 ed hands and feet filled with quick fingers and a remarkable tail
 which is allbyitself alive.(and he has a little red coat with i
 have a real pocket in it and the round funny hat with a big feather
 is tied under myhis chin.)   that climbs and cries and runs and
 floats like a toy on the end of a string
