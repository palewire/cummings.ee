 Harun Omar and Master Hafiz
 keep your dead beautiful ladies.
 Mine is a little lovelier
 than any of your ladies were.

 In her perfectest array
 my lady,moving in the day,
 is a little stranger thing
 than crisp Sheba with her king
 in the morning wandering.
   Through the young and awkward hours
 my lady perfectly moving,
 through the new world scarce astir
 my fragile lady wandering
 in whose perishable poise
 is the mystery of Spring
 (with her beauty more than snow
 dexterous and fugitive
 my very frail lady drifting
 distinctly,moving like a myth
 in the uncertain morning,with
 April feet like sudden flowers
 and all her body filled with May)
 —moving in the unskilful day
 my lady utterly alive,
 to me is a more curious thing
 (a thing more nimble and complete)
 than ever to Judea’s king
 were the shapely sharp cunning
 and withal delirious feet
 of the Princess Salomé
 carefully dancing in the noise
 of Herod’s silence,long ago.

 If she a little turn her head
 i know that i am wholly dead:
 nor ever did on such a throat
 the lips of Tristam slowly dote,
 La beale Isoud whose leman was.
 And if my lady look at me
 (with her eyes which like two elves
 incredibly amuse themselves)
 with a look of færie,
 perhaps a little suddenly
 (as sometimes the improbably
 beauty of my lady will)
 —at her glace my spirit shies
 rearing(as in the miracle
 of a lady who had eyes
 which the king’s horses might not kill.)
   But should my lady smile,it were
 a flower of so pure surprise
 (it were so very new a flower,
 a flower so frail,a flower so glad)
 as trembling used to yield with dew
 when the world was young and new
 (a flower such as the world had
 in Springtime when the world was mad
 and Launcelot spoke to Guenever,
 a flower which most heavy hung
 with silence when the world was young
 and Diarmid looked in Grania’s eyes.)
   But should my lady’s beauty play
 at not speaking(sometimes as
 it will)the silence of her face
 doth immediately make
 in my heart so great a noise,
 as in the sharp and thirsty blood
 of Paris would not all the Troys
 of Helen’s beauty:never did
 Lord Jason(in impossible things
 victorious impossibly)
 so wholly burn,to undertake
 Medea’s rescuing eyes;nor he
 when swooned the white egyptian day
 who with Egypt’s body lay.

 Love as those ladies were
 mine is a little lovelier.
 And if she speak in her frail way,
 it is wholly to bewitch
 my smallest thought with a most swift
 radiance wherein slowly drift
 murmurous things divinely bright;
 it is foolingly to smite
 my spirit with the lithe free twitch
 of scintillant space,with the cool writhe
 of gloom truly which syncopate
 some sunbeam’s skilful fingerings;
 it is utterly to lull
 with foliate inscrutable
 sweetness my soul obedient;
 it is to stroke my being with
 numbing forests frolicsome,
 fleetly mystical,aroam
 with keen creatures of idiom
 (beings alert and innocent
 very deftly upon which
 indolent miracles impinge)
 —it is distinctly to confute
 my reason with the deep caress
 of every most shy thing and mute,
 it is to quell me with the twinge
 of all living intense things.
   Never my soul so fortunate
 is(past the luck of all dead men
 and loving)-as invisibly when
 upon her palpable solitude
 a furtive occult fragrance steals,
 a gesture of immaculate
 perfume—whereby (with fear aglow)
 my soul is wont wholly to know
 the poignant instantaneous fern
 whose scrupulous enchanted fronds
 toward all things intrinsic yearn,
 the immanent subliminal
 fern of her delicious voice
 (of her voice which always dwells
 besides the vivid magical
 impetuous and utter ponds
 of dream;and very secret food
 its leaves inimitable find
 beyond the white authentic springs,
 beyond the sweet instinctive wells,
 which make to flourish the minute
 spontaneous meadow of her mind)
 —the vocal fern,always which feels
 the keen ecstatic actual tread
 (and thereto perfectly responds)
 of all things exquisite and dead,
 all living things and beautiful.
 (Caliph and king their ladies had
 to love them and to make them glad
 when the world was young and mad,
 in the city of Bagdad—
 mine is a little lovelier
 than any of those ladies were.)

 Her body is most beauteous,
 being for all things amorous
 fashioned very curiously
 of roses and of ivory.
 The immaculate crisp head
 is such as only certain dead
 and careful painters love to use
 for their youngest angels(whose
 praising bodies in a row
 between slow glories fleetly go.)
 Upon a keen and lovely throad
 the strangeness of her face doth float,
 which in eyes and lips consists
 —always upon the mouth there trysts
 curvingly a fragile smile
 which like a flower lieth(while
 withing the eyes is dimly hear
 a wistful and precarious bird.)
 Springing from fragrant shoulders small,
 ardent,and perfectly withal
 smooth to stroke and sweet to see
 as a supple and young tree,
 her slim lascivious arms alight
 in skilful wrists which hint at flight
 —my lady’s very singular
 and slenderest hands moreover are
 (which as lilies smile and quail)
 of all things perfect the most frail.

 (Whose rideth in the tale
 of Chaucer knoweth many a pair
 of companions blithe and fair;
 who to walk with Master Gower
 in Confessio doth prefer
 shall not lack for beauty there,
 nor he that will amaying go
 with my log Boccaccio—
 whose knocketh at the door
 of Marie and of Maleore
 findeth of ladies goodly store
 whose beauty did in nothing err.
 If to me there shall appear
 than a rose more sweetly known,
 more silently than a flower,
 my lady naked in her hair—
 i for those ladies nothing care
 nor any lady dead and gone.)

 Each tapering breast is firm and smooth
 than in a lovely fashion doth
 from my lady’s body grow;
 as morning may a lily known,
 her petaled flesh doth entertain
 the adriot blood’s mysterious skein
 (but like some passionate earlier
 flower, the snow will oft utter,
 whereof the year has perfect bliss—
 for each breast a blossom is,
 which being a little while caressed
 its fragrance makes the lover blest.)
 Her waist is a most tiny hinge
 of flesh,a winsome thing and strange;
 apt in my hand warmly to lie
 it is a throbbing neck whereby
 to grasp the belly’s ample vase
 (that urgent urn which doth amass
 for whoso drinks,a dizzier wine
 than should the grapes of heaven combine
 with earth’s madness)—’tis a gate
 unto a palace intricate
 (whereof the luscious pillars rise
 which are her lage and shapely thighs)
 in whose dome the trembling bliss
 of a kingdom wholly is.
   Beneath her thighs such legs are seen
 as were the pride of the world’s queen:
 each is a verb,miraculous
 inflected oral devious,
 beneath the body’s breathing noun
 (moreover the delicious frown
 of the grave great sensual knees
 well might any monarch please.)
 Each ankle is divinely shy;
 as if for fear you would espy
 the little distinct food(if whose
 very minuteness doth abuse
 reason,why then the artificer
 did most exquistiely err.)

 When the world was like a song
 heard behind a golden door,
 poet and sage and caliph had
 to love them and to make them glad
 ladies with lithe eyes and long
 (when the world was like a flower
 Omar Hafiz and Harun
 loved their ladies in the moon)
 —fashioned very curiously
 of roses and of ivory
 if naked she appear to me
 my flesh is an enchanted tree;
 with her lips’ most frail parting
 my body hears the cry of Spring,
 and with their frailest syllable
 its leaves go crisp with miracle.

 Love!—maker of my lady,
 in that alway beyond this
 poem or any poem she
 of whose body words are afraid
 perfectly beautiful is.
 forgive these words which i have made.
 And never boast your dead beauties,
 you greatest lovers in the world!
 who with Grania strangely fled,
 who with Egypt went to bed,
 whom white-thighed Semiramis
 put up her mouth to wholly kiss—
 never boast your dead beauties,
 mine being unto me sweeter
 (of whose shy delicious glance
 things which never more shall be,
 perfect things of færie,
 are intense inhabitants;
 in whose warm superlative
 body do distinctly live
 all sweet cities passed away—
 in her flesh at break of day
 are the smells of Nineveh,
 in her eyes when day is gone
 are the cries of Babylon.)
 Diarmuid Paris and Solomon,
 Omar Harun and Master Hafiz,
 to me your ladies are all one—
 keep your dead beautiful ladies.

 Eater of all things lovely—Time!
 upon whose watering lips the world
 poises a moment(futile,proud,
 a costly morsel of sweet tears)
 gesticulates,and disappears—
 of all dainties which do crowd
 gaily upon oblivion
 sweeter than any there is one;
 to touch it is the fear of rhyme—
 in life’s very fragile hour
 (when the world was like a tale
 made of laughter and of dew,
 was a flight,a flower,a flame,
 was a tendril fleety curled
 upon frailness)used to stroll
 (very slowly)one or two
 ladies like flowers made,
 softly used to wholly move
 slender ladies made of dream
 (in the lazy world and new
 sweetly used to laugh and love
 ladies with crisp eyes and frail,
 in the city of Bagdad.)

 Keep your dead beautiful ladies
 Harun Omar and Master Hafiz.
