title: Songs II

first_line: Always before your voice my soul

text: |-1
 Always before your voice my soul
 half-beautiful and wholly droll
 is as some smooth and awkward foal,
 whereof young moons begin
 the newness of his skin

 so of my stupid sincere youth
 the exquisite failure uncouth
 discovers a trembling and smooth
 Unstrength,against the strong
 silences of your song;

 or as a single lamb whose sheen
 of full unsheared fleece is mean
 besides its lovelier friends,between
 your thoughts more white than wool
 My thought is sorrowful:

 but my heart smote in trembling thirds
 of anguish quivers to your words,
 As to a flight of thirty birds
 shakes with a thickening fright
 the sudden fooled light.

 it is autumn of the year:
 When through the thin air stooped with fear,
 acrosss the harvest whitely peer
 empty of surprise
 death’s faultless eyes

 (whose hand my folded soul shall know
 while on faint hills do frailly go
 The peaceful terrors of the snow,
 and before your dead face
 which sleeps,a dream shall pass)

 and these my days their sounds and flowers
 Fall in a pride of petaled hours,
 like flowers at the feet of mowers
 whose bodies strong with love
 through meadows hugely move.

 yet what am i that such and such
 mysteries very simply touch
 me,whose heart-wholeness overmuch
 Expects of your hair pale,
 a terror musical?

 while in an earthless hour my fond
 soul seriously yearns beyond
 this fern of sunset frond on frond
 opening in a rare
 Slowness of gloried air...

 The flute of morning stilled in noon—
 noon the implacable bassoon—
 now Twilight seeks the thrill of moon,
 washed with a wild and thin
 despair of violin
