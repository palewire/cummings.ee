text: |-1
 The fingers make early flowers of
 all things.
 thy hair mostly the hours love:
 a smoothness which
 sings,saying
 (though love be a day)
 do not fear, we will go amaying.

 the whitest feet crisply are straying.
 Always
 they moist eyes are at kisses playing,
 whose strangeness much
 says;singing
 (thought love be a day)
 for which girl art thou flowers bringing?

 To be they lips is a sweet thing
 and small.
 Death,Thee i call rich beyond wishing
 if this thou catch,
 else missing.
 (though love be a day
 and life be nothing,it shall not stop kissing).
