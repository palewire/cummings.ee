first_line: All in green went my love riding

text: |-1
 All in green went my love riding
 on a great horse of gold
 into the silver dawn.

 four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
 the merry deer ran before.

 Fleeter be they than dappled dreams
 the swift sweet deer
 the red rare deer.

 Four red roebuck at a white water
 the cruel bugle sang before.

 Horn at hip went my love riding
 riding the echo down
 into the silver dawn.

 four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
 the level meadows ran before.

 Softer be they than slippered sleep
 the lean lithe deer
 the fleet flown deer.

 Four fleet does at a gold valley
 the famished arrow sang before.

 Bow at belt went my love riding
 riding the mountain down
 into the silver dawn.

 four lean houds crouched low and smiling
 the sheer peaks ran before.

 Paler be they than daunting death
 the sleek slim deer
 the tall tense deer.

 Four tall stags at a green mountain
 the lucky hunter sang before.

 All in green went my love riding
 on a great horse of gold
 into the silver dawn.

 four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
 my heart fell dead before.
