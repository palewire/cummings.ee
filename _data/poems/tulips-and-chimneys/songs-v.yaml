 Doll’s boy ’s asleep
 under a stile
 he sees eight and twenty
 ladies in a line
 
 the first lady
 says to nine ladies
 his lips drink water
 but his heart drinks wine
 
 the tenth lady
 says to nine ladies
 they must chain his foot
 for his wrist ’s too fine
 
 the nineteenth
 says to nine ladies
 you take his mouth
 for his eyes are mine.
 
 Doll’s boy ’s asleep
 under the stile
 for every mile the feet go
 the heart goes nine
