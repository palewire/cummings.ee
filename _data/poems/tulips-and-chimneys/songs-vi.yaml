 when god lets my body be

 From each brave eye shall sprout a tree
 fruit that dangles therefrom

 the purpled world will dance upon
 Between my lips which did sing

 a rose shall beget the spring
 that maidens whom passion wastes

 will lay between their little breasts
 My strong fingers beneath the snow

 Into strenuous birds shall go
 my love walking in the grass

 their wings will touch her face
 and all the while shall my heart be

 With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea
