 a thing most new complete fragile intense,
 which wholly trembling memory undertakes
 —your kiss,the little pushings of flesh,makes
 my body sorry when the minute moon
 is a remarkable splinter in the quick
 of twilight
            ....or if sunset utters one
 unhurried muscled huge chromatic
 fist skilfully modeling silence
 —to feel how through the stopped entire day
 horribly and seriously thrills
 the moment of enthusiastic space
 is a little wonderful,and say
 Perhaps her body touched me;and to face
 
 suddenly the lighted living hills
