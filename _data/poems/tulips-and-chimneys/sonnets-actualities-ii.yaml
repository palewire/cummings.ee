first_line: my love is buiding a building

text: |-1
 my love is buiding a building
 around you,a frail slippery
 house,a strong fragile house
 (beginning at the singular beginning
 
 of your smile)a skilful uncouth
 prison,a precise clumsy
 prison(building thatandthis into Thus,
 Around the reckless magic of your mouth)
 
 my love is building a magic,a discrete
 tower of magic and(as i guess)
 
 when Farmer Death(whom fairies hate)shall
 
 crumble the mouth-flower fleet
 He’ll not my tower,
                    laborious, casual
 
 where the surrounded smile
                            hangs
 
                                  breathless
