 yours is the music for no instrument
 yours the preposterous colour unbeheld

 —mine the unbought contemptuous intent
 till this our flesh merely shall be excelled
 by speaking flower
                   (if i have made songs

 it does not greatly matter to the sun,
 nor will rain care
                   cautiously who prolongs
 unserious twilight)Shadows have begun

 the hair’s worm huge,ecstatic,rathe....

 yours are the poems i do not write.

 In this at least we have got a bulge of death,
 silence,and the keenly musical light

 of sudden nothing....la bocca mia “he
 kissed wholly trembling”

                         or so thought the lady.
