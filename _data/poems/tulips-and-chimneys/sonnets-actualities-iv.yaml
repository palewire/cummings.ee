 by little accurate saints thickly which tread
 the serene nervous light of paradise—
 by angelfaces clustered like bright lice

 about god’s capable dull important head—
 by on whom glories whisperingly impinge
 (god’s pretty mother)but may not confuse

 the clever hair nor rout the young mouth whose
 lips being a smile exactly strange—
 this painter should have loved my lady.
 And by this throad a little suddenly lifted

 in singing—hands fragile whom almost tire
 the sleepshaped lilies—

                         should my lady’s body
 with these frail ladies dangerously respire:

 impeccable girls in raiment laughter-gifted.
