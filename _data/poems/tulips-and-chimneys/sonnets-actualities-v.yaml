 notice the convulsed orange inch of moon
 perching on this silver minute of evening.

 We’ll choose the way to the forest—no offense
 to you,white town whose spires softly dare.
 Will take the houseless wisping rune
 of road lazily carved on sharpening air.

 Fields lying miraculous in violent silence

 fill with microscopic whithering
 ...(that’s the Black People,cherie,
 who live under stones.) Don’t be afraid

 and we will pass the simple ugliness
 of exact tombs,where a large road crosses
 and all the people are minutely dead.

 Then you will slowly kiss me
