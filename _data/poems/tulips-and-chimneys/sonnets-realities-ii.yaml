 goodby Betty,don’t remember me
 pencil your eyes dear and have a good time
 with the tall tight boys at Tabari’
 s,keep your teeth snowy,stick to beer and lime,
 wear dark,and where your meeting breasts are round
 have roses darling,it’s all i ask of you—
 but that when light fails and this sweet profound
 Paris moves with lovers,two and two
 bound for themselves,when passionate dusk
 brings softly down the perfume of the world
 (and just as smaller stars begin to husk
 heaven)you, you exactly paled and curled

 with mystic lips take twilight where i know:
 proving to Death that Love is so and so.
