title: Sonnets Realities III

 ladies and gentlement this little girl
 with the good teeth and small important breasts
 (is it the Frolic or the Century whirl?
 one’s memory indignantly protests)
 this little dancer with the tightened eyes
 crisp ogling shoulders and the ripe quite too
 large lips always clenched faintly, wishes you
 with all her fragile might to not surmise
 she dreamed on afternoon
                         .... or maybe read?
 
 of a time when the beautiful most of her
 (this here and This, do you get me?)
 will maybe dance and maybe sing and be
 abslatively posolutely dead,
 like Coney Island in winter
