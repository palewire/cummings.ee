 “kitty”. sixteen,5’ 1”,white,prostitute.

 ducking always the touch of must and shall,
 whose slippery body is Death’s littlest pal,

 skilled in quick softness.   Unspontaneous.   cute.

 the signal perfume of whose unrepute
 focusses in the sweet slow animal
 bottomless eyes importantly banal,

 Kitty.  a whore.  Sixteen
                          you corking brute
 amused from time to time by clever drolls
 fearsomely who do keep their sunday flower.
 The babybreasted broad “kitty” twice eight

 —beer nothing,the lady’ll have a whiskey-sour—

 whose least amazing smile is the most great
 common divisor of unequal souls.
