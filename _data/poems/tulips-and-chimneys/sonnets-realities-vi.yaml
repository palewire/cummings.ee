 when thou hast taken thy last applause,and when
 the final curtain strikes the world away,
 leaving to shadowy silence and dismay
 that stage which shall not know they smile again,
 lingering a little while i see thee then
 ponder the tinsel part they let thee play;
 i see the large lips livid,the face grey,
 and silent smileless eyes of Magdalen.
 The lights have laughed their last;without,the street
 darkling awaiteth her whose feet have trod
 the silly souls of men to golden dust:
 she pauses on the lintel of defeat,
 her heart breaks in a smile—and she is Lust....
