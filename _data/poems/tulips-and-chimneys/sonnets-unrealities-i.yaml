 it may not always be so; and i say
 that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch
 another’s, and your dear strong fingers clutch
 his heart, as mine in time not far away;
 if on another’s face your sweet hair lay
 in such silence as i know, or such
 great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
 stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;
 
 if this should be, i say if this should be—
 you of my heart, send me a little word;
 that i may go unto him, and take his hands,
 saying, Accept all happiness from me.
 Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird
 sing terribly afar in the lost lands.
