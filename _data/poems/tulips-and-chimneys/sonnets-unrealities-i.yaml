 it may not always be so;and i say
 that if your lips,which i have loved,should touch
 another’s,and your dear strong fingers clutch
 his heart,as mine in time not far away;
 if on another’s face your sweet hair lay
 in such silence as i know,or such
 great writhing words as,uttering overmuch,
 stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;

 if this should be,i say if this should be—
 you of my heart,send me a little word;
 that i may go unto him,and take his hands,
 saying, Accept all happiness from me.
 Then shall i turn my face,and hear one bird
 sing terribly afar in the lost lands.
