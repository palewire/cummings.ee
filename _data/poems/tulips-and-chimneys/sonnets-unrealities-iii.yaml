 it is at moments after i have dreamed
 of the rare entertainment of your eyes,
 when(being fool to fancy)i have deemed

 with your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;
 at moments when the glassy darkness holds

 the genuine apparition of your smile
 (it was through tears always)and silence moulds
 such strangeness as was mine a little while;

 moments when my once more illustrious arms
 are filled with a fascination,when my breast
 wears the intolerant brightness of your charms:

 one pierced moment whiter than the rest

 —turning from the tremendous lie of sleep
 i watch the roses of the day grow deep.
