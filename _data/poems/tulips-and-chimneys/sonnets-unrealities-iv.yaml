 when citied day with the sonorous homes
 of light swiftly sink in the sorrowful hour,
 they counted petals O tremendous flower
 on whose huge heart prospecting darkness roams

 torture my spirit with the exquisite froms
 and whithers of existence,
                           as by shores
 soundless,the unspeaking watcher who adores

 perceived sails whose might brightness dumbs

 the utterance of his soul—so even i
 wholly chained to a grave astonishment
 feel in my being the delirious smart

 of thrilled ecstasy,where sea and sky
 marry—

       to know the white ship of thy heart

 on frailer ports of costlier commerce bent
