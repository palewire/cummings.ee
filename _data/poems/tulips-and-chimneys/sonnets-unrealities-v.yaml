text: |-1
 a wind has blown the rain away and blown
 the sky away and all the leaves away,
 and the trees stand.   I think i too have known
 autumn too long

               (and what have you to say,
 wind wind wind—did you love somebody
 and have you the petal of somewhere in your heart
 pinched from dumb summer?
                           O crazy daddy
 of death dance cruelly for us and start

 the last leaf whirling in the final brain
 of air!)Let us as we have seen see
 doom’s integration.........a wind has blown the rain

 away and the leaves and the sky and the
 trees stand:
             the trees stand.   The trees,
 suddenly wait against the moon’s face.
