 a connotation of infinity
 sharpens the temporal splendor of this night

 when souls which have forgot frivolity
 in lowliness,noting the fatal flight
 of worlds whereto this earth’s a hurled dream

 down eager avenues of lifelessness

 consider for how much themselves shall gleam,
 in the poised radiance of perpetualness.
 When what’s in velvet beyond doomed thought

 is like a woman amorous to be known;
 and man,whose here is always worse than naught,
 feels the tremendous yonder for his own—

 on such a night the sea through her blind miles

 of crumbling silence seriously smiles
