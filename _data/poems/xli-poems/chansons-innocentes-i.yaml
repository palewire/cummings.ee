first_line: why did you go

text: |-1
 why did you go
 little fourpaws?
 you forgot to shut
 your big eyes

 where did you go?
 like little kittens
 are all the leaves
 which open in the rain.

 little kittens who
 are called spring,
 is what we stroke
 maybe asleep?

 do you know?or maybe did
 something go away
 every so quietly
 when we werenâ€™t looking.
