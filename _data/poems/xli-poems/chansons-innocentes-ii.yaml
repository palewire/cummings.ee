 little tree
 little silent Christmas tree
 you are so little
 you are more like a flower

 who found you in the green forest
 and were you very sorry to come away?
 see    i will comfort you
 because you smell so sweetly

 i will kiss your cool bark
 and hug you safe and tight
 just as your mother would,
 only don’t be afraid

 look      the spangles
 that sleep all the year in a dark box
 dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,
 the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,

 put up your little arms
 and i’ll give them all to you to hold
 every finger shall have its ring
 and there won’t be a single place dark or unhappy

 then when you’re quite dressed
 you’ll stand in the window for everyone to see
 and how they’ll stare!
 oh but you’ll be very proud

 and my little sister and i will take hands
 and looking up at our beautiful tree
 we’ll dance and sing
 “Noel Noel”
