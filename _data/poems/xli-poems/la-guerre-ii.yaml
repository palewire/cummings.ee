first_line: Humanity i love you

text: |-1
 Humanity i love you
 because you would rather black the boots of
 success than enquire whose soul dangles from his
 watch-chain which would be embarassing for both

 parties and because you
 unflinchingly applaud all
 songs containing the words country home and
 mother when sung at the old howard

 Humanity i love you because
 when you’re hard up you pawn your
 intelligence to buy a drink and when
 you’re flush pride keeps

 you from the pawn shop and 
 because you are continually committing
 nuisances but more
 especially in your own house

 Humanity i love you because you 
 are perpetually putting the secret of
 life in your pants and forgetting
 it’s there and sitting down

 on it
 and because you are
 forever making poems in the lap 
 of death Humanity

 i hate you
