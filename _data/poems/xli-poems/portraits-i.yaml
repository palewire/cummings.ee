text: |-1
 conversation with my friend is particularly

 to enjoy the composed sudden body atop which always quiv-
 ers the electric Distinct face haughtily vital clinched
 in a swoon of synopsis

 despite a sadistic modesty his mind is seen frequently
 fingering the exact beads of a faultless languor when
 invisibly consult with some delicious image the a little
 strolling lips and eyes inwardly crisping

 for my friend,feeling is the sacred and agonizing prox-
 imity to its desire of a doomed impetuous acute sentience
 whose whitehot lips however suddenly approached may never
 quite taste the wine which their nearness evaporates

 to think is the slippery contours of a vase inexpressibly
 fragile it is for the brain irrevocably frigid to touch a
 merest shape which however slenderly by it caressed
 will explode and spill the immediate imperceptible content

 my friendâ€™s being,out of the spontaneous clumsy trivial
 acrobatic edgeless gesture of existence,continually whit-
 tles keen careful futile flowers

 (isolating with perpetually meticulous concupiscence the
 bright large undeniable disease of Life, himself occasion-
 ally contrives an unreal precise intrinsic fragment of
 actuality),

 an orchid whose velocity is sculptural
