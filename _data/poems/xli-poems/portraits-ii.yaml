 one April dusk the
 sallow street-lamps were turning
 snowy against a west of robin’s egg blue when
 i entered a mad street whose

 mouth dripped with slavver of
 spring
 chased two flights of squirrel-stairs into
 a mid-victorian attic which is known as
 O ΠΑΡΘΕΝΩΝ
            and having ordered
 yaoorti from
 Nicho’
 settled my feet on the 

 ceiling inhaling six divine inches
 of Haremina        in
 the thick of the snick-
 er of cards and smack of back-

 gammon boards i was aware of an entirely
 dirty circle of habitués their
 faces like cigarettebutts, chewed
 with disdain,       lead by a Jumpy

 Tramp who played each
 card as if it were a thunderbolt red-
 hot      peeling
 off huge slabs of a fuzzy

 language with the aid of an exclamatory
 tooth-pick
 And who may that
 be i said exhaling into

 eternity as Nicho’ laid
 before me bread
 more downy than street-lamps
 upon an almostclean

 plate
 “Achilles” 
 said
 Nicho’

 “and did you perhaps wish also shishkabob?”
