 the skinny voice

 of the leatherfaced
 woman with the crimson
 nose and coquettishly-
 cocked bonnet

 having ceased     the

 captain
 announces that as three
 dimes seven nickels and ten
 pennies have been deposited upon

 the drum   there is need

 of just twenty five cents
 dear friends
 to make it an even
 dollar      whereupon

 the Divine Average who was

 attracted by the inspired
 sister’s howling moves
 off
 will anyone tell him why he should

 blow two bits for the coming of Christ Jesus
 
 ?
 ??
 ???
 !

 nix, kid
