first_line: it’s just like a coffin’s

text: |-1
 it’s just like a coffin’s
 inside when you die,
 pretentious and
 shiny and
 not too wide
              dear god

 there’s a portrait
 over the door very notable of
 the sultan’s nose pullable and rosy
 flanked by the scrumptious magdalene
 of whoisit and madame
 something by gainsborough
                           just the playthings
                           for dust   n’es-ce pas

    effendi drifts between
    tables like an old leaf
    between toadstools
 he is the cheerfulest of men
    his peaked head smoulders
    like a new turd in April
    his legs are brittle and small
    his feet large and fragile
 his queer hands twitter before him,like foolish
    butterflies
 he is the most courteous of men

 should you remark the walls have been repapered

 he will nod
            like buddha
            or answer modestly
 i am dying

 so let us come in together and
 drink coffee covered with froth
 half-mud
 and not too
 sweet?
