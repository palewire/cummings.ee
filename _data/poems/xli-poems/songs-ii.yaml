 of my
 soul a street is:
 prettinesses Pic-
 abian tricktrickclickflick-er
 garnished
 of stark Picasso
 throttling trees

 hither
 my soul
 repairs herself with
 prisms of sharp mind
 and Matisse rhythms
 to juggle Kandinsky gold-fish

 away from the gripping gigantic
 muscles of Cézanne’s
 logic,
       oho.
       a street
 there is

 where strange birds    purr
