 after five
 times the poem
 of thy remembrance
 surprises with refrain

 of unreasoning summer
 that by responding
 ways cloaked with renewal
 my body turns toward

 thee
 again     for the stars have been
 finished in the nobler trees and
 the language of leaves repeats

 eventual perfection
 while east deserves of dawn.
 i lie at length,breathing
 with shut eyes

 the sweet earth where thou liest
