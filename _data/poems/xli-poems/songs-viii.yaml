text: |-1
 in the rain-
 darkness,    the sunset
 being sheathed i sit and
 think of you

 the holy
 city which is your face
 your little cheeks the streets
 of smiles

 your eyes half-
 thrush
 half-angel and your drowsy
 lips where float flowers of kiss

 and
 there is the sweet shy pirouette
 your hair
 and then

 your dancesong
 soul.    rarely-beloved
 a single star is
 uttered,and i

 think
       of you
