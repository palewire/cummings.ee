 the hills
 like poets put on
 purple thought against
 the

 magnificent clamor of
                        day
 tortured
 in gold,which presently

 crumpled
 collapses.
 exhaling a red soul into the dark


 so
 duneyed master
 enter
 the sweet gates
 
                    of my heart and
 take
 the
 rose,

 which perfect
 is
 With killing hands
