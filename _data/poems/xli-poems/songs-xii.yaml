 cruelly,love
 walk the autumn long;
 the last flower in whose hair,
 thy lips are cold with songs

 for which is
 first to wither,to pass?
 shallowness of sunlight
 falls and,cruelly,
 across the grass
 Comes the
 moon

 love,walk the
 autumn
 love,for the last
 flower in the hair withers;
 thy hair is acold with
 dreams,
 love thou art frail

 â€”walk the longness of autumn
 smile dustily to the people,
 for winter
 who crookedly care.
