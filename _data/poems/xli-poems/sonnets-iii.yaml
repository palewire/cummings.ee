 when unto nights of autumn do complain
 earth’s ghastlier trees by whom Time measured is
 when frost to dance maketh the sagest pane
 of littler huts with peerless fantasies
 or the unlovely longness of the year

 droops with things dead athwart the narrowing hours
 and hope (by cold espoused unto fear)
 in dreadful corners hideously cowers—

 i do excuse me, love, to Death and Time

 storms and rough cold, wind’s menace and leaf’s grieving:
 from the impressed fingers of sublime
 Memory, of that loveliness receiving
 the image my proud heart cherished as fair.

 (The child-head poised with the serious hair)
