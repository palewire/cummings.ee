first_line: 'this is the garden:colours come and go'

text: |-1
 this is the garden:colours come and go,
 frail azures fluttering from night’s outer wing
 strong silent greens serenely lingering,
 absolute lights like baths of golden snow.
 This is the garden:pursed lips do blow
 upon cool flutes within wide glooms,and sing
 (of harps celestial to the quivering string)
 invisible faces hauntingly and slow.

 This is the garden.   Time shall surely reap
 and on Death’s blade lie many a flower curled,
 in other lands where other songs be sung;
 yet stand They here enraptured,as among
 the slow deep trees perpetual of sleep
 some silver-fingered fountain steals the world.

# Question 1: Should any and all lines with colons in them be wrapped in single quotes?
# Question 2: Are there multiple spaces before "Time shall..." or is that just justification
# in the original?
