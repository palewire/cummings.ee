 when my sensational moments are no more
 unjoyously bullied of vilest mind

 and sweet uncaring earth by thoughtful war
 heaped wholly with high wilt of human rind—
 when over hate has triumphed darkly love

 and the small spiritual cry of spring
 utters a striving flower,
                           just where strove
 the droll god-beasts

                      do thou distinctly bring
 thy footstep, and the rushing of thy deep
 hair and the smiting smile didst love to use
 in other days (drawing my Mes from sleep
 whose stranger dreams thy strangeness must abuse....)

 Time being not for us, purple roses were
 sweeter to thee
                 perchance to me deeper.
