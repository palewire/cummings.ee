 and what were roses.  Perfume? for i do
 forget....or mere Music mounting unsurely

 twilight
          but here were something more maturely
 childish, more beautiful almost than you.

 Yet if not flower, tell me softly who

 be these haunters of dreams always demurely
 halfsmiling from cool faces, moving purely
 with muted step, yet somewhat proudly too—

 are they not ladies, ladies of my dreams
 justly touching roses their fingers whitely
 live by?
          or better,
                     queens, queens laughing lightly
 crowned with far colours,

                           thinking very much
 of nothing and whom dawn loves most to touch

 wishing by willows, bending up streams?
