first_line: come nothing to my comparable soul

text: |-1
 come nothing to my comparable soul
 which with existence has conversed in vain,
 O scrupulously take thy trivial toll,
 for whose cool feet this frantic heart is fain;
 try me with thy perfumes which have seduced
 the mightier nostrils of the fervent dead,
 feed with felicities me wormperused
 by whom the hungering mouth of time is fed:
 and if i like not what thou givest me
 to him let me complain,whose seat is where
 revolving planets struggle to be free
 with the astounding everlasting air—
 but if i like,i'll take between thy hands
 what no man feels,no woman understands.
