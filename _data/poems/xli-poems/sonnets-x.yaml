 I have seen her stealthily frail
 flower walking with its fellows in the death
 of light,against whose enormous curve of flesh
 exactly cubes of tiny fragrance try;
 i have watched certain petals rapidly wish
 in the corners of her youth;whom,fiercely shy
 and gently brutal,the prettiest wrath
 of blossoms dishevelling made a pale
 fracas upon the accurate moon....
 Across the important gardens her body
 will come toward me with its hurting sexual smell
 of lilies....beyond night’s silken immense swoon
 the moon is like a floating silver hell
 a song of adolescent ivory.
