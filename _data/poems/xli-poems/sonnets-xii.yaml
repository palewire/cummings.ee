first_line: perhaps it is to feel strike

text: |-1
 perhaps it is to feel strike
 the silver fish of her nakedness
 with fins sharply pleasant, my

 youth has travelled toward her these years

 or to snare the timid like
 of her mind to my mind that i

 am come by little countries to the yes

 of her youth.
               And if somebody hears
 what i say—let him be pitiful:
 because i've travelled all alone
 through the forest of wonderful,
 and that my feet have surely known
 the furious ways and the peaceful,

 and because she is beautiful
