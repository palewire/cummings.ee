 will suddenly trees leap from winter and will

 the stabbing music of your white youth
 wounded by my arms’ bothness
 (say a twilight lifting the fragile skill
 of new leaves’ voices, and sharp lips of spring
 simply joining with the wonderless
 city’s sublime cheap distinct mouth)

 do the exact human comely thing?

 (or will the fleshless moments go and go

 across this dirtied pane where softly preys
 the grey and perpendicular Always—
 or possibly there drift a pulseless blur
 of paleness;
             the unswift mouths of snow
 insignificantly whisper....
