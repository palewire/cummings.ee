 a fragrant sag of fruit distinctly grouped.

 I have not eaten peppers for a week.

 On this street the houses immensely speak
 (it is nine minutes past six)

 the well-fed L’s immaculate roar looped
 straightens,into neatest distance....

 A new curve of children gladly cricks
 where a hurdy-gurdy accurately pants.

 and pompous ancient jews obscurely twitch
 through the bumping teem of Grand. a nudging froth
 of faces clogs Second as Mrs. Somethingwich

 (with flesh like an old toy balloon)

 heavily swims to Strunsky’s,

                             Monia’s mouth
 eats tangerines looking at the moon—
