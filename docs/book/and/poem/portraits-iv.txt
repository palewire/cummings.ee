Portraits IV

the waddling
madam star
taps
taps.     “ready girls”.   the

unspontaneous streets
make bright their eyes
a
blind irisher fiddles a

scotch jig in a stinking
joyman bar
a cockney is
buying whiskies for a turk

a waiter intones:bloo-moon-n
sirkusricky
platzburg
hoppytoad    yesmam.    the

furious taximan
p(ee)ps
on his whistle somebody
says here’s luck

somebody else says down the hatch
the nigger smiles
the jew stands
beside his teddy-bears

the sailor shuffles the
night with fucking eyes
the great black preacher gargles jesus
the aesthete indulges

his soul for certain things which died
itis eighteen hundred
years....
exactly

   under the window
   under the window
   under the window walk

the unburied feet of
the little ladies more than dead
