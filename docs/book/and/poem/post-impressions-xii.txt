Post Impressions XII

suppose
Life is an old man carrying flowers on his head.

young death sits in a café
smiling,a piece of money held between
his thumb and first finger

(i say “will he buy flowers” to you
and “Death is young
life wears velour trousers
life totters,life has a beard” i

say to you who are silent.—“Do you see
Life?he is there and here,

or nothing or an old man 3 thirds
asleep,on his head
flowers,always crying
to nobody something about les
roses les bluets
                 yes,
                     will He buy?
Les belles bottes—oh hear
pas chères”)

she is sitting beside young death,is slender;
likes flowers.
