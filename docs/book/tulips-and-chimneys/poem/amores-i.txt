Amores I

consider O
woman this
my body.
for it has

lain
with empty arms
upon the giddy hills
to dream of you,

approve these
firm unsated
eyes
which have beheld

night’s speechless carnival
the painting
of the dark
with meteors

streaming from playful
immortal hands
the bursting
of the wafted stars

(in time to come you shall
remember of this night amazing
esctasies    slowly,
in the glutted

heart fleet
flowerterrible
memories
shall

rise, slowly
return upon the
                red elected lips

scaleless visions)
