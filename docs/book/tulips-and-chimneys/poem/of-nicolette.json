  "text": "dreaming in marble all the castle lay\nlike some gigantic ghost-flower born of night\nblossoming in white towers to the moon,\nsoft sighed the passionate darkness to the tune\nof tiny troubadours,and(phantom-white)\ndumb-blooming boughs let fall their glorious snows,\nand the unearthly sweetness of a rose\nswam upward from the troubled heart of May;\n\na Winged Passion woke one by one\nthere fell upon the night,like angel's tears,\nthe syllables of that mysterious prayer,\nand as an opening lily drowsy-fair\n(when from her couch of poppy petals peers\nthe sleepy morning)gently draws apart\nher curtains,and lays bare her trembling heart,\nwith beads of dew made jewels by the sun,\n\nso one high shining tower(which as a glass\nturned light to flame and blazed with snowy fire)\nunfolding,gave the moon a nymphlike face,\na form whose snowy symmetry of grace\nhaunted the limbs of as music haunts the lyre,\na creature of white hands,who letting fall\na thread of lustre from the castle wall\ngilded,a drop of radiance,to the grass—\n\nshunning the sudden moonbeam's treacherous snare\nshe sought the harbouring dark,and(catching up\nher delicate silk)all white,with shining feet,\nwent forth into the dew:right wildly beat\nher heart at every kiss of daisy-cup,\nand from her cheek beauteous colour went\nwith every bough that reverently bent\nto touch the yellow wonder of her hair.",
