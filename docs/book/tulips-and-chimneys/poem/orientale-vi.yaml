  I.
   
  the emperor
  sleeps in a palace of porphyry
  which was a million years building
  he takes the air in howdah
  of jasper beneath saffron
  umbrellas
  upon an elephant
  twelve feet high
  behind whose ear
  sits always a crowned
  king twir-
  ling an
  ancus of
  ebony
  the fountains of the emperor’s
  palace run sunlight and
  moonlight and the emperor’s
  elephant is a thousand years old

  the harem of
  the emperor
  is carpeted with
  gold cloth
  from the
  ceiling (one
  diamond timid
  with nesting incense)
  fifty
  marble
  pillars
  slipped from immeasurable
  height, fall, fifty, silent
   
  in the incense is tangled a cool moon

  there are thrice-three-hundred
  doors carven of chalcendony and
  before every door a naked
  eunuch watches
  on their heads turbans of a hundred
  colours
  in their hands scimitars like windy torches
  each
  is
  blacker than oblivion

  the ladies
  of the emperor’s
  harem are queens
  of all the earth and the rings
  upon their hands are from mines
  a mile deep
  but the body of
  the queen of queens is
  more transparent
  than water, she is softer than birds

     2.

     when the emperor is very
     amorous he reclines upon
     the couch of couches and
     beckons    with
     the little finger of his left
     hand
          then the
     thrice-three-hundredth
     door is opened by the tallest
     eunuch and the queen
     of queens comes
     forth
     ankles
     musical with large pearls
     kingdoms in her ears
     
     at the feeet of
     the emperor a cithern-
     player squats with
     quiveringgold
     body
     behind

  the emperor ten
  elected warriors with
  bodies of lazy jade
  and twitching
  eyelids
  finger
  their
  unquiet
  spears

  the queen of queens is dancing

  her subtle
  body weaving
  insinuating upon the gold cloth
  incessantly creates patterns of sudden
  lust
  her
  stealing body ex-
  pending gathering pouring upon itself     stiffenS
  to a
  white thorn
  of desire

  the taut neck of the citharede wags
  in the dust the ghastly warriors
  amber with lust breathe
  together   the emperor, exerting
  himself amoung his pillows throws
  jewels at the queen of queens and
  white money upon her nakedness
  he
  nods
           and all
  depart through the bruised air aflutter with pearls

           3.

           they are
           alone
           he beckons, she rises she
           stands
           a moment
           in the passion of the fifty
           pillars
           listening
           
           while the queens of all the
           earth writhe upon deep rugs
