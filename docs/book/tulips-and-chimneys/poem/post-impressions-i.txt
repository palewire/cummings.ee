Post Impressions I

beyond the brittle towns asleep
i look where stealing needles of foam
in the last light

thread creeping shores


as out of dumb strong hands infinite

the erect deep upon me
in the last light
pours its eyeless miles


the chattering sunset ludicrously
dies, i hear only tidewings

in the last light
twitching at the world
