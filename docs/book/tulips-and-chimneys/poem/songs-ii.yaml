  Always before your voice my soul
  half-beautiful and wholly droll
  is as some smooth and awkward foal,
  whereof young moons begin
  the newness of his skin

  so of my stupid sincere youth
  the exquisite failure uncouth
  discovers a trembling and smooth
  Unstrength, against the strong
  silences of your song;

  or as a single lamb whose sheen
  of full unsheared fleece is mean
  besides its lovelier friends, between
  your thoughts more white than wool
  My thought is sorrowful;

  but my heart smote in trembling thirds
  of anguish quivers to your words,
  As to a flight of thirty birds
  shakes with a thickening fright
  the sudden fooled light.

  it is autumn of the year:
  When through the thin air stooped with fear,
  acrosss the harvest whitely peer
  empty of surprise
  death’s faultless eyes

  (whose hand my folded soul shall know
  while on faint hills do frailly go
  The peaceful terrors of the snow,
  and before your dead face
  which sleeps, a dream shall pass)

  and these my days their sounds and flowers
  Fall in a pride of petaled hours,
  like flowers at the feet of mowers
  whose bodies strong with love
  through meadows hugely move.

  yet what am i that such and such
  mysteries very simply touch
  me, whose heart-wholeness overmuch
  Expects of your hair pale,
  a terror musical?

  while in an earthless hour my fond
  soul seriously yearns beyond
  this fern of sunset frond on frond
  opening in a rare
  Slowness of gloried air . . .

  The flute of morning stilled in noon—
  noon the implacable bassoon—
  now Twilight seeks the thrill of moon,
  washed with a wild and thin
  despair of violin
