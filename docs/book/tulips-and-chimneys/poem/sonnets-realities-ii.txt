Sonnets—Realities II

goodby Betty,don’t remember me
pencil your eyes dear and have a good time
with the tall tight boys at Tabari’
s,keep your teeth snowy,stick to beer and lime,
wear dark,and where your meeting breasts are round
have roses darling,it’s all i ask of you—
but that when light fails and this sweet profound
Paris moves with lovers,two and two
bound for themselves,when passionate dusk
brings softly down the perfume of the world
(and just as smaller stars begin to husk
heaven)you, you exactly paled and curled

with mystic lips take twilight where i know:
proving to Death that Love is so and so.
